/*
 * A stream is an arbitrary buffer, whose contents generally are assumed to
 * be in network order.
 *
 * A stream has the following attributes associated with it:
 *
 * - size: the allocated, invariant size of the buffer.
 *
 * - getp: the get position marker, denoting the offset in the stream where
 *         the next read (or 'get') will be from. This getp marker is
 *         automatically adjusted when data is read from the stream, the
 *         user may also manipulate this offset as they wish, within limits
 *         (see below)
 *
 * - endp: the end position marker, denoting the offset in the stream where
 *         valid data ends, and if the user attempted to write (or
 *         'put') data where that data would be written (or 'put') to.
 *
 * These attributes are all size_t values.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1. getp can never exceed endp
 *
 * - hence if getp is equal to endp, there is no more valid data that can be
 *   gotten from the stream (though, the user may reposition getp to earlier in
 *   the stream, if they wish).
 *
 * 2. endp can never exceed size
 *
 * - hence, if endp is equal to size, then the stream is full, and no more
 *   data can be written to the stream.
 *
 * In other words the following must always be true, and the stream
 * abstraction is allowed internally to assert that the following property
 * holds true for a stream, as and when it wishes:
 *
 *        getp <= endp <= size
 *
 * It is the users responsibility to ensure this property is never violated.
 *
 * A stream therefore can be thought of like this:
 *
 * 	---------------------------------------------------
 * 	|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                         |
 * 	---------------------------------------------------
 *               ^               ^                        ^
 *               getp            endp                     size
 *
 * This shows a stream containing data (shown as 'X') up to the endp offset.
 * The stream is empty from endp to size. Without adjusting getp, there are
 * still endp-getp bytes of valid data to be read from the stream.
 *
 * Methods are provided to get and put to/from the stream, as well as
 * retrieve the values of the 3 markers and manipulate the getp marker.
 *
 * Note:
 * At the moment, newly allocated streams are zero filled. Hence, one can
 * use stream_forward_endp() to effectively create arbitrary zero-fill
 * padding. However, note that stream_reset() does *not* zero-out the
 * stream. This property should **not** be relied upon.
 *
 * Best practice is to use stream_put (<stream *>, NULL, <size>) to zero out
 * any part of a stream which isn't otherwise written to.
