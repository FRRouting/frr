/*
 * this locking primitive is intended to use in a 1:N setup.
 *
 * - one "counter" seqlock issuing increasing numbers
 * - multiple seqlock users hold references on these numbers
 *
 * this is intended for implementing RCU reference-holding.  There is one
 * global counter, with threads locking a seqlock whenever they take a
 * reference.  A seqlock can also be idle/unlocked.
 *
 * The "counter" seqlock will always stay locked;  the RCU cleanup thread
 * continuously counts it up, waiting for threads to release or progress to a
 * sequence number further ahead.  If all threads are > N, references dropped
 * in N can be free'd.
 *
 * generally, the lock function is:
 *
 * Thread-A                  Thread-B
 *
 * seqlock_acquire(a)
 *    | running              seqlock_wait(b)      -- a <= b
 * seqlock_release()            | blocked
 * OR: seqlock_acquire(a')      |                 -- a' > b
 *                           (resumes)
