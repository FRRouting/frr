/* This is a "pull-driven" write event handler.  Instead of having some buffer
 * or being driven by the availability of data, it triggers on the space being
 * available on the socket for data to be written on and then calls fill() to
 * get data to be sent.
 *
 * pullwr_* maintains an "idle" vs. "active" state, going into idle when a
 * fill() call completes without feeing more data into it.  The overall
 * semantics are:
 * - to put data out, call pullwr_write().  This is possible from both inside
 *   fill() callbacks or anywhere else.  Doing so puts the pullwr into
 *   active state.
 * - in active state, the fill() callback will be called and should feed more
 *   data in.  It should NOT loop to push out more than one "unit" of data;
 *   the pullwr code handles this by calling fill() until it has enough data.
 * - if there's nothing more to be sent, fill() returns without doing anything
 *   and pullwr goes into idle state after flushing all buffered data out.
 * - when new data becomes available, pullwr_bump() should be called to put
 *   the pullwr back into active mode so it will collect data from fill(),
 *   or you can directly call pullwr_write().
 * - only calling pullwr_write() from within fill() is the cleanest way of
 *   doing things.
 *
 * When the err() callback is called, the pullwr should be considered unusable
 * and released with pullwr_del().  This can be done from inside the callback,
 * the pullwr code holds no more references on it when calling err().

/* max_spin_usec is the time after which the pullwr event handler will stop
 *   trying to get more data from fill() and yield control back to the
 *   thread_master.  It does reschedule itself to continue later; this is
 *   only to make sure we don't freeze the entire process if we're piping a
 *   lot of data to a local endpoint that reads quickly (i.e. no backpressure)
 *
 *   default: 2500 (2.5 ms)
 *
 * write_threshold is the amount of data buffered from fill() calls at which
 *   the pullwr code starts calling write().  But this is not a "limit".
 *   pullwr will keep poking fill() for more data until
 *   (a) max_spin_usec is reached; fill() will be called again later after
 *       returning to the thread_master to give other events a chance to run
 *   (b) fill() returns without pushing any data onto the pullwr with
 *       pullwr_write(), so fill() will NOT be called again until a call to
 *       pullwr_bump() or pullwr_write() comes in.
 *
 *   default: 16384 (16 kB)
 *
 * passing 0 for either value (or not calling it at all) uses the default.
