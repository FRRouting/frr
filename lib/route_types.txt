# Canonical Zserv route types information registry for Quagga.
#
# Used to construct route_types.c and route_types.h
#
# comma-seperated fields of either 2 fields (help strings) or 7 fields.
# White space before and after the comma seperators is stripped.
# Lines /beginning/ with # are comments.
#
####
# 9 field line has format:
# ZServ route type, canonical name, daemon, route char, ipv4, ipv6, redist, short desc, Restrictions
#
# Zserv route type: 	Corresponding with zebra.h. Key field.
# canonical name:	Typically derived from the route type definition.
#			Used in 'redistribute' commands in daemons.
#			Key field.
# daemon:		The daemon which may originates this route type
#			for redistribution to other daemons.
#			NULL if not applicable.
#			M:N definitions of type:daemon are allowed.
#			Used to construct vty command strings.
# route char:		Single character to denote the route, if applicable.
#			Used to denote route type where space is tight,
#			e.g. 'show ip route' / 'show ipv6 route'.
#			'X' is reserved as the 'not needed' placeholder.
# ipv4:			IPv4 capable? yes/no, or 1/0.
# ipv6:			IPv6 capable? ditto.
# redist:               Allow this protocol to be used in redistribution statements
# short desc:		Very brief description. Used in header of
#			'show ip route'. May be specified as NULL
#			if the canonical name suffices.
# Restriction:          If this cannot be used with the listed protocol for redistribution events
#
# Key fields obviously must be a unique ASCII alpha-numeric word.
#   Lower-case is required, brevity is optional but highly desirable.
#
####
# 2 field format:
#
# Zserv route type, Long description
#
# Long description:     Full description, but should try fit on a line.
####
#
# If you add a new routing protocol here, make sure you also update
# meta_queue_map in zebra_rib.c
