2008-06-07 Paul Jakma <paul@jakma.org>

	* stream.{c,h}: (stream_{put,write}) add const qualifier to source
	  argument. Change u_char to void *.

2008-06-02 Denis Ovsienko

	* workqueue.[ch]: completely drop WQ_AIM_HEAD flag and
	  work_queue_aim_head() function, they aren't needed any more
	  with the new meta queue structure; (work_queue_run) don't
	  increment the counter on work item requeueing

2008-02-28 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* log.c: (mes_lookup) Sowmini Varadhan diagnosed a problem where
	  this function can cause a NULL dereference, on lookups for unknown
	  indices, or messages with NULL strings. Can occur, e.g., debug
	  logging code when processing received messages. Fixed to accept a
	  pointer to a default string to be used if there is no match.
	* log.h: LOOKUP adjusted to match

2008-02-28 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* linklist.c: This implementation expects that the data pointer not
	  be null, e.g. listgetdata() asserts this. The list add methods
	  don't apply the same sanity check.

	  Noted by Jim Carlson in bug #437.

2008-01-11 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: Revert previous change, no need to include <net/if_media.h>
	  here.

2008-01-10 Ingo Flaschberger <if@xip.at>

	* zebra.h: If HAVE_BSD_LINK_DETECT is defined, include <net/if_media.h>.

2008-01-08 Pavol Rusnak <prusnak@suse.cz>

	* memory.c: (mtype_memstr) Fix accidental shift past width of type,
	  constant should have been forced to UL, rather than being left to
	  default to int.

2007-11-12 Denis Ovsienko

	* linklist.c: (listnode_add_after) Don't forget to increment list
	  items counter.
	* workqueue.h: Changed working queue flags from enum into integer
	  and introduced WQ_AIM_HEAD flag to indicate our will to insert
	  new data before the list head.
	* workqueue.[ch]: (work_queue_schedule, show_work_queues,
	  work_queue_plug, work_queue_unplug) Adjust to the new flags style.
	* workqueue.[ch]: (work_queue_aim_head) new function to control the
	  WQ_AIM_HEAD flag
	* workqueue.[ch]: (work_queue_new) Explicitly set both WQ flags
	  during new WQ initialization.
	* workqueue.[ch]: (work_queue_add) If WQ_AIM_HEAD indicates a need
	  to place the new data into list head, do it.

2007-10-22 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@colitti.com>

	* smux.c: (smux_stop) Avoid cancelling a defunct thread pointer
	  (smux_start) Stop smux before trying to start it, possibly again.

2007-10-04 Denis Ovsienko

	* pid_output.c: (pid_output) stop using LOGFILE_MASK
	  (0600 by default), introduce and use PIDFILE_MASK (0644)
	  instead.

2007-09-18  Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* privs.c: definition of ZCAP_NET_ADMIN on Solaris should
	  be PRIV_SYS_IP_CONFIG, when that's available. Thus allowing
	  Quagga to work with in Solaris zones with exclusive IP
	  instances.

2007-08-21 Denis Ovsienko

	* sockopt.[ch]: (setsockopt_so_sendbuf, getsockopt_so_sendbuf):
	  new functions to adjust ospfd working socket.

2007-08-13 Denis Ovsienko

	* zebra.h: introduce ZEBRA_ERR_KERNEL and ZEBRA_ERR_NOERROR

2007-07-06 Atis Elsts <atis@mikrotik.com>

	* pqueue.{c,h}: Export trickle_up

2007-07-26  Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* log.c: (mes_lookup) warning about code not being in same-number
	  array slot should be debug, not warning. E.g. BGP has several
	  discontigious number spaces, allocating from different parts of a
	  space is not uncommon (e.g. IANA assigned versus vendor-assigned
	  code points in some number space).
	  
2007-07-06 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sockopt.{c,h}: (setsockopt_multicast_ipv4) Add some comments about
	  the arguments.

2007-06-01 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: On linux, we seem to need to include <linux/types.h> before
	  <sys/sysctl.h>, otherwise we get isisd compilation errors about
	  __be16 not being defined.

2007-05-10 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* zebra.h: Don't try define _GNU_SOURCE, autoconf should do it.

2007-05-03 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memtypes.c: Add MTYPE_ATTR_EXTRA and MTYPE_BGP_ROUTE_EXTRA

2007-05-01 David L Stevens <dlstevens@us.ibm.com>

	* (general) These changes collectively add route-map and
	  prefix-list support to zebra and fix a bug in "show
	  route-map" (with no argument).
	* command.h: added PROTOCOL_NODE type
	* log.c: (proto_name2num) new function, protocol name to
	  number translation.
	* routemap.c: (vty_show_route_map) fixed "show route-map"
	  without route-map name
	* routemap.h: added RMAP_ZEBRA type
	* zebra.h: added proto_name2num() prototype

2007-04-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (quagga_timestamp) Optimize the subsecond timestamp generation.

2007-04-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* command.c: (config_write_host) Save "log timestamp precision"
	  if not default value.
	  (show_logging) Show configured timestamp precision.
	  (config_log_timestamp_precision) Enable configuration of timestamp
	  precision.
	  (no_config_log_timestamp_precision) Restore default timestamp
	  precision.
	  (cmd_init) Install new timestamp precision commands.
	* log.h: (struct zlog) New timestamp_precision field.
	  (quagga_timestamp) New function to generate a timestamp with the
	  desired precision.
	  (struct timestamp_control) Declare a structure for use in avoiding
	  repeated duplicate calls to quagga_timestamp.
	* log.c: (quagga_timestamp) New function to generate a timestamp
	  of the desired precision.
	  (time_print) Call quagga_timestamp if the time hasn't already been
	  calculated.
	  (vzlog) Initialize a timestamp_control structure and pass it to
	  time_print and vty_log.
	  (zlog_backtrace) Fix 64-bit problem: cannot print size_t with %u.
	* vty.h: Must now include "log.h".
	  (vty_log) Takes an additional struct timestamp_control argument.
	* vty.c: (vty_log_out) Use new struct timestamp_control and new
	  quagga_timestamp function to print timestamps of the desired
	  precision.
	  (vty_time_print) Use new quagga_timestamp function.
	  (vty_log) Accept new struct timestamp_control argument and pass it
	  down to vty_log_out.

2007-04-27 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* smux.c: (smux_trap) Fix printf format to work with 64-bit size_t.

2007-04-07 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* prefix.h: Add define to match IPv4 Link-Local addresses

2007-03-20 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (mes_lookup) Make the function more robust: check for
	  cases where the index does not match the key value at that position.
	  If so, give a warning and fall back to a linear search.
	  And improve the error message in cases where even that fails.

2006-12-12 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: (struct connected) Add new ZEBRA_IFA_PEER flag indicating
	  whether a peer address has been configured.  Comment now shows
	  the new interpretation of the destination addr: if ZEBRA_IFA_PEER
	  is set, then it must contain the destination address, otherwise
	  it may contain the broadcast address or be NULL.
	  (CONNECTED_DEST_HOST,CONNECTED_POINTOPOINT_HOST) Remove obsolete
	  macros that were specific to IPv4 and not fully general.
	  (CONNECTED_PEER) New macro to check ZEBRA_IFA_PEER flag.
	  (CONNECTED_PREFIX) New macro giving the prefix to insert into
	  the RIB: if CONNECTED_PEER, then use the destination (peer) address,
	  else use the address field.
	  (CONNECTED_ID) New macro to come up with an identifying address
	  for the struct connected.
	* if.c: (if_lookup_address, connected_lookup_address) Streamline
	  logic with new CONNECTED_PREFIX macro.
	* prefix.h: (PREFIX_COPY_IPV4, PREFIX_COPY_IPV6) New macros
	  for better performance than the general prefix_copy function.
	* zclient.c: (zebra_interface_address_read) For non-null destination
	  addresses, set prefixlen to equal the address prefixlen.  This
	  is needed to get the new CONNECTED_PREFIX macro to work properly.

2006-10-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* if.c: (general) Handle upgrades from SUNWzebra, which tried
	  to track each logical interface as a seperate struct
	  interface, to Quagga, which assigns only one struct interface
	  per ifindex.
	  (if_sunwzebra_get) Try decompose a logical interface name
          (fooX:Y) to the 'primary' name (fooX), for Solaris.
          (interface_cmd) Use if_sunwzebra_get on Solaris.

2006-09-26 Pierre-Yves Ritschard <pierre-yves@spootnik.org>

	* smux.c: (smux_open,smux_trap,smux_register) Fix various
	  asn_build_* calls to pass the proper length in the final
	  argument: use sizeof(<variable>) instead of sizeof(<type>),
	  since there were several inconsistencies between the actual
	  variable type and the size that was passed.  This should
	  fix some problems on 64-bit architectures where sizeof(int)
	  != sizeof(long).

2006-08-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* thread.c: (general) Add support for monotonic clock, it may still
	  jump forward by huge amounts, but should be immune to going
	  backwards. Fixes bug #134.
	  (quagga_gettimeofday_relative_adjust) helper, does what name
	  says - adjusts gettimeofday based relative timer.
	  (quagga_gettimeofday) helper to keep recent_time up to date.
	  (quagga_get_relative) helper, update and getch the relative
	  timer using gettimeofday(). POSIX CLOCK_MONOTONIC is also
	  supported, but the code is not enabled yet nor tested.
	  (quagga_real_stabilised) helper, retrieve absolute time but
	  stabilised so as to never decrease.
	  (quagga_gettime) Exported interface, analogous to POSIX
	  clock_gettime() in interface, supporting several clocks.
	  (quagga_time) Exported interface, analogous to traditional
	  time(), will never decrease.
	  (recent_relative_time) Convenience function to retrieve
	  relative_time timeval, similar to existing recent_time absolute
	  timeval, for when an approximately recent value will do.
	  (remainder) Update to use above helpers.
	  (thread_getrusage) Previously was a macro, but needs to be
	  a function to twiddle with thread.c private stuff.
	* thread.c: Point the GETRUSAGE macro at previous function.
	  Export quagga_gettime, quagga_time and recent_relative_time for 
	  general use.

2006-07-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* thread.h: (struct thread) Add a cache pointer to the struct
	  cpu_thread_history, if it is known - saving hash lookup on
	  each thread_call.
	* thread.c: (thread_call) Cache the pointer to the
          cpu_thread_history, so that future thread_calls of same
          thread can avoid the hash_lookup.

2006-07-10 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.c: (vty_log_out) Do not call vty_close, because this could
	  result in a parent function's accessing the freed memory.
	  Instead, set status VTY_CLOSE and call shutdown(vty->fd, SHUT_RDWR).
	  And add a comment on vty_close.

2006-07-10 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.c: (vty_log_out, vty_read, vty_flush, vtysh_flush, vtysh_read)
	  After an I/O error, must set vty->monitor to 0 before calling
	  zlog_warn, otherwise an infinite recursion could occur
	  (since zlog_warn triggers a message to be written to the vty,
	  and that in turn triggers another error message when it fails, etc.).

2006-07-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.c: (vty_log_out) Debug messages to terminal vty sessions
	  should include timestamps.

2006-06-28 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memory.c: Fix typo in cpp conditional around malloc.h, from
	  comment in bug #269.

2006-06-27 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* route_types.awk: Remove setting the 'bare' numeric route type
	  in redist strings.

2006-06-15 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.c: (cmd_describe_command_real) Fix leak, CID #38.
	* memory.h: Experimental, have XFREE macro NULL out the freed
	  pointer.
	* linklist.c: (list_delete) call list_delete_all_node, don't
	  duplicate it.
	* if.c: (if_flag_dump) remove the whitespace indentation, callers
	  should provide.

2006-05-28 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* zebra.h: Include inttypes.h rather than stdint.h, best practice
	  according to the autoconf manual.
	  Add UINT*_MAX defines for older platforms lacking these (FBSD 4)
	* memory.c: malloc.h is deprecated in favour of stdlib.h, however
	  we still need it on GNU Libc for mallinfo().
	* vty.c: (vty_log/vty_log_fixed) dont crash if called when vty
	  hasn't been initiliased.
	* log.c: (general) Add support for Sun libc printstack().
	  (hex_append) make the cpp conditional on general HAVE_STACK_TRACE
	  define.
	  (zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) Ditto. Add printstack() version of the
	  the DUMP macro in this function.

2006-05-23 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* route_types.txt: New file, table of ZEBRA_ROUTE definitions.
	* route_types.awk: New script, to parse previous and generate
	  (for now) redistribute string defines.
	* Makefile.am: build route_types.h using previous two, ala
	  memtypes.h, include the script and table file in EXTRA_DIST.
	* command.h: pull in route_types.h, add a REDIST_STR define.

2006-05-21 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: (struct connected) Document the meaning of the
	  ZEBRA_IFC_REAL and ZEBRA_IFC_CONFIGURED flags.

2006-05-15 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* log.c: (general) Generalise struct zebra_route_desc into
	  struct zebra_desc_table and, similar to route_types, add a
	  command_types table to describe Zserv protocol commands.
	  (route_types[]) use a macro to use designated initialisers
	  while avoiding tedious duplication.
	  (zserv_command_string) lookup string from zebra_desc_table,
	  similar to zebra_route_string
	* zebra.h: Add declaration for zserv_command_string, adjust the
	  comments to reflect zebra_desc_table.

2006-05-13 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* vty.c: (vty_describe_command) CID #39 fix was too hasty, just
	  cause it /can/ leak doesn't mean it always will have, check
	  first.

2006-05-12 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* plist.c: (vty_prefix_list_uninstall) Fix potential NULL deref
	  of prefix and typestr strings, Coverity CID #3.
	* command.c: (cmd_complete_command_real) Fix leak of cmd_vector
	  in error case, Coverity CID #37.
	  (cmd_describe_command_real) Fix return of freed pointer when
	  no-match, CID #55.
	* vty.c: (vty_describe_command) fix leak of describe vector in
	  error path, CID #39.

2006-03-30 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.h: (DEFUN_CMD_FUNC_TEXT) Annotate arguments as
	  potentially being unused.
	* workqueue.c: (work_queue_run) fix line length of comment

2006-03-27 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memtypes.awk: Fix gensub call, g should be a string..

2006-03-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* workqueue.h: (struct work_queue) Remove status field and
	  state flag, no longer used.

2006-03-19 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memtypes.c: Add MTYPE_BGP_SYNCHRONISE.

2006-03-16 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Fix -version-info argument.

2006-03-15 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memory.c: (mtype_memstr) new helper function to 
	  return human friendly string for a byte count.
	  (mtype_stats_alloc) new function, for users to retrieve
	  number of objects allocated.
	  (show_memory_mallinfo) New function, show mallinfo statistics
	  if available.
	  (show_memory_all_cmd) Call show_memory_mallinfo, if mallinfo
	  is available.
	* memory.h: Export mtype_memstr and mtype_stats_alloc.
	  Provide a define for a reasonable buffer size for
	  mtype_memstr.
	  
2006-03-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* privs.c: (zprivs_caps_init) Change user IDs before lowering
	  privileges, while this seems to work on Linux, on Solaris
	  it rightfully refuses due to PRIV_PROC_SETID having been
	  dropped.
	* command.h: Add the struct host global exported from command.c

2006-03-06 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* if.h: export show_address_cmd, for anyone who wishes to use
	  it.

2006-02-21 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* sockunion.c: (sockunion_{su2str,log}) Use XSTRDUP.
	  Particularly with _su2str, as that string gets XFREEd,
	  which can be annoying if run debug code in memory.c.

2006-02-02 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* workqueue.h: (struct work_queue) Remove the delay field.
	  It served no purpose and just introduced bad behaviour.
	  Should be excised before its allowed to escape into 1.0.
	  This removes need for the 'flood' and runs_since_clear
	  fields.
	* workqueue.c: (general) excise delay factor between queue
	  runs, hence the 'flood' crap too.. See above.

2006-01-19 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* stream.c: (stream_getq_from) should use POSIX uint64_t
	  not u_int64_t. Latter is neither a traditional BSD type, nor
	  a POSIX type.

2006-01-17 Vincent Jardin <vincent.jardin@6wind.com>

	* md5.c: Don't forget to keep const.
	* regex.c: Cleanup code and remove warnings.

2006-01-17 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* md5.{c,h}: (md5_loop) Is better off taking a void * and doing
	  cast to byte wise type internally, avoids needs for casts 
	  in users.
	* vty.c: (no_terminal_monitor_cmd) New ALIAS for 
	  terminal_no_monitor, in the more normal negating format,
	  to be kind to my fingers.
	  (vty_init) install new ALIAS.
	* zclient.{c,h}: (zclient_create_header) export this, seems others
	  could use it (in lieu of more complete zserv helpers).

2006-01-16 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* zclient.h: Update the Zserv protocol header with a version
	  field.  Define the old command field to be a 'marker', to
	  allow old Zserv and updated Zserv to be differentiated.
	  Future updates will bump the version field obviously. New
	  command field is made wider.  Try to stop using the
	  'zebra_size_t' typedef in the callbacks.
	* zclient.c: Update to read/write new format header.

2006-01-11 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* if.h: (struct interface) expand flags to 8 bytes.
	* zclient.c: (zebra_interface_{add,state}_read) stream read of
	  interface flags now need to use stream_getq.
	  (zebra_interface_if_set_value) ditto

2006-01-10 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* stream.c: (stream_new) Allocate stream data as seperate object.
	  (stream_free) free the data.
	  (stream_resize) new function, resize stream to new size.
	  (stream_{get,put}q*) new functions to get/put quad word size
	  types.
	* stream.h: (struct stream) make data seperate from the stream.
	  Export new stream_resize and quad-word get/put functions.
	  
2005-12-29  Greg Troxel  <gdt@fnord.ir.bbn.com>

	* vty.c (vty_hello): add cast to quiet lint (from David Young)

2005-11-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* buffer.c: (struct buffer_data) change gcc zero array
	  declaration to C99 incomplete array.
	* stream.h: (struct stream) same

2005-11-24 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* privs.c: (zcaps2sys/solaris) remove unused variable.
	  (zprivs_state_caps/solaris) Format string missing a
	  specifier.
	* zebra.h: s/u_int/unsigned int/, u_int is a BSD type, defining
	  __USE_BSD on Linux pulls in further things from netinet/ip.h
	  which dont preprocess for some reason. There is no C99
	  shorthand type directly equivalent to u_int afaict, so don't
	  use it.

2005-11-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) pass struct work-queue to callback functions.
	* workqueue.h: (struct work_queue) move the state flag
	  variables to end.
	  Add an opaque pointer to spec, for user-data global to the
	  queue.
	  Pass reference to work_queue to all callbacks.
	* workqueue.c: (work_queue_item_remove) pass ref to workqueue
	  to user callbacks.
	  (work_queue_run) ditto.

2005-11-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) Add state to detect queue floods.  There's no sense
	  trying to be sparing of CPU resources, if the queue is
	  flooding and using ever more memory resources. we should just
	  get on with clearing the queue.
	  The sense of delay and hold were wrong way around, fix.
	* workqueue.h: (struct work_queue) Add status bitfield.  Add
	  'flood' integer to workqueue spec.  Add runs_since_clear
	  counter to workqueue.
	* workqueue.c: (work_queue_new) set defaults for delay, hold
	  and flood.
	  (work_queue_add) initial schedule should use delay, not hold.
	  (show_work_queues) Print flood field, conserve whitespace.
	  (work_queue_unplug) use delay, not hold.
	  (work_queue_run) consecutive runs should be seperated by hold
	  time, not delay.
	  Keep track of number of consecutive runs, go into 'overdrive'
	  if queue is being flooded, we can't avoid making heavy use of 
	  resources, better to use CPU than ever more RAM.
	* zebra.h: [bug #231] include stdint, if its there.

2005-11-05 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* routemap.c: (vty_show_route_map_entry) call action is
	  seperate from exit action, latter should still be printed
	  regardless of whether a call is specified.

2005-11-03 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* zebra.h: BSD BYTE_ORDER define isn't available everywhere,
	  define if needs be.
	* checksum.h: new file. checksum.c exports in_cksum, provide
	  a header for it.
	* checksum.c: (in_cksum) callers shouldn't have to know it uses
	  a u_short internally, change to void *.
	* Makefile.am: Add checksum.h
	* command.h: remove bogus trailling slash.
	* md5.c: (general) Update it for the twentieth century. ANSI
	  declarations are widely supported now.. Don't include system
	  headers, only include zebra.h. Use POSIX types (the
	  alternative is to define u_int64_t in a portable way - rest
	  of Quagga needs same cleanup).
	  Make endian-conditional code be compiler conditional rather
	  than preprocessor conditional, so that breakage gets noticed
	  quicker.
	* md5.h: POSIX types. Get rid of the odd __P() non-ANSI capable
	  compiler compatibility hack.
	* if.c: (connected_free) use MTYPE for connected label.
	* memtypes.c: Add MTYPE_CONNECTED_LABEL
	* memtypes.h: Update auto-built file.

	  including fixing some likely leaks in config_write_file.
	* vty.c: memory macro usage fixes. 
	  (vty_read_config) fix leak where relative config file is
	  specified.

2005-10-20 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sockopt.c: (setsockopt_multicast_ipv4) If IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
	  fails with errno equal to EADDRINUSE, then issue an info
	  message and try IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP followed by IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP.

2005-10-20 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* memory.c: (show_memory_vty) Omit zero statistics.  Print separators

	  zebra_route_char().
	* log.c: (zroute_lookup,zebra_route_string,zebra_route_char) New
	  functions to map zebra route numbers to strings.

2005-09-29 Alain Ritoux <alain.ritoux@6wind.com>

	  namelen).

2005-09-29 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* zebra.h: Solaris capabilities requires priv.h to be included.
	* privs.{c,h}: Add support for Solaris Least-Privileges.
	  privs.h: Reduce some of the abstract capabilities, which do
	  not have rough equivalents on both systems. Rename the net
	  related caps to _NET, as they should have been in first
	  place.
	  (zprivs_terminate) should take the zebra_privs_t as argument so
	  that it can update change pointer.
	  Add an additional privilege state, ZPRIVS_UNKNOWN.
	* privs.c: (various capability functions) Add
	  Solaris privileges variants.
	  (zprivs_state) Use privs.c specific generic types to
          represent various capability/privilege related types, so that
          each can be typedef'd as appropriate on each platform.
	  (zprivs_null_state) static added, to hold the state the null
	  method should report (should be raised by default, and
          LOWERED if zprivs_terminate has been called)
          (zprivs_state_null) Report back the zprivs_null_state.
          (cap_map) Make it able to map abstract capability to multiple
          system capabilities.

          (zprivs_init) move capability related init to seperate
	  function, zprivs_caps_init.
          (zprivs_terminate) ditto, moved to zprivs_caps_terminate.
          Set the change_state callback to the NULL state, so the
          user can continue to run and use the callbacks.
          
2005-09-29 Alain Ritoux <alain.ritoux@6wind.com>

	* filer.c: show protocol name in filter_show()

	* routemap.c: show protocol name in vty_show_route_map_entry()
	* vty.c: in vty_command(), show protocol name if command unknown
	
2005-09-28 Alain Ritoux <alain.ritoux@6wind.com>

	* md5-gnu.h: removed
	* md5.h: replaces md5-gnu.h
	* Makefile.am: use correct md5.h
	* md5.c: import from WIDE

2005-09-21 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memtypes.{c,h}: Add MTYPE_AS_SEG_DATA.
	
2005-09-19 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* str.[ch]: Add strndup() from glibc.

2005-09-05 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.c: (install_element) be more robust. Eg, cmd_init
	  need not have been called, some applications may use other
	  library subsystems, which call install_element, without the
          application wanting commands and hence not calling cmd_init.
        
2005-08-22 Hugo Santos <hsantos@av.it.pt>

	* command.h: (enum node_type) Add BGP_IPV6M_NODE 
	* command.c: (node_parent) Handle BGP_IPV6M_NODE node
	  (config_exit, config_end) ditto
	* vty.c: (vty_end_config) Handle BGP_IPV6M_NODE node
	
2005-08-10  Greg Troxel  <gdt@fnord.ir.bbn.com>

	* getopt.h: Don't declare getopt (rather than getopt_long), since
	quagga doesn't need it.
	* getopt.c (getopt): Don't define getopt.

2005-07-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>
	* prefix.c: (prefix_ipv4_new, prefix_ipv6_new): Call prefix_new
	  to allocate the memory to make sure that all struct prefix pointers
	  point to objects of the same length (avoids memory overruns
	  on struct prefix assignments).
	  (prefix_ipv4_free, prefix_ipv6_free): Simply call prefix_free.
	  It is interesting to note that these functions are never actually
	  called anywhere in the code.  Instead prefix_free was already
	  being called directly, despite the previous MTYPE incompatibility.

2005-07-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* prefix.c: (ip_masklen) While loop should test that 'pnt' pointer is
	  in range before dereferencing it.

2005-06-24 Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com>

	* getopt.h: add further tests for full getopt declaration on
	  various systems.

2005-06-18 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

2005-06-01 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memtypes.c: Add MTYPE_BGP_PROCESS_QUEUE and
	  MTYPE_BGP_CLEAR_NODE_QUEUE

2005-05-24 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* memtypes.h: update this auto-built file. (maybe we should just
	  remove it, is GNU awk a terrible dependency to have?)

2005-05-23 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* memtypes.awk: use character classes, which work correctly in
	  all LC_COLLATE environments, unlike A-Z, which doesnt work in
	  eg estonian collate order. Reported by Hasso.
	* routemap.c: (rmap_onmatch_goto) fix crash if 'continue' command
	  is used, which does not supply an argv[0].
	  this is a backport candidate /iff/ the trailing ; is removed
	  from VTY_GET_INTEGER_RANGE
	* vty.h: fix the VTY_GET macros, do {..} while(0) so they have
	  correct function like syntax in usage.
	* workqueue.h: Add a WQ_QUEUE_BLOCKED item_status return code,
	  to allow a queue function to indicate the queue is not
	  ready/blocked - rather than any problem with the item at hand.
	  Add a notion of being able to 'plug' and 'unplug' a queue.
	  Add helpers to plug/unplug a queue.
	  Add a completion callback, to be called when a queue is emptied.
	* workqueue.c: (work_queue_new) remove useless list_free.
	  (work_queue_schedule) new internal helper function to schedule
	  queue, if appropriate.
	  (work_queue_add) use work_queue_schedule

	  / scheduled / processed again.
	  (work_queue_run) Add support for WQ_QUEUE_BLOCKED.
	  Add comment for RETRY_NOW case.
	  Make hysteris more aggresive in ramping up granularity, improves
	  performance significantly.
	  Add support for calling completion callback when queue is emptied,
	  possibly useful for knowing when to unplug a queue.

2005-05-19 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* thread.c: (thread_cancel_event) the number of pending events
	  cancelled is potentially useful information, dont throw it away,
	  pass it back to the caller.
	* sockunion.c: (sockunion_getsockname) use MTYPE_SOCKUNION, not TMP
	  (sockunion_getpeername) ditto
	* memtypes.c: (memory_list_bgp) add MTYPE_BGP_PEER_HOST

2005-05-15 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* getopt.h: It's not just __GNU_LIBRARY__ which defines
	  getopt, eg __EXTENSIONS__ does too on SunOS. It still seems
	  awfully fragile though.
	* getopt.c: include zebra.h after config.h, before including
	  getopt.h so that things at least are consistent..
	* getopt1.c: ditto
	
2005-05-07 Yar Tikhiy <yar@comp.chem.msu.su>

	* sockopt.c: Add support for BSD style ifindex in ip_mreq.

2005-05-06 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* (general) extern and static'ification of functions in code and
	  header.
	  Cleanup any definitions with unspecified arguments.
	  Add casts for callback assignments where the callback is defined,
	  typically, as passing void *, but the function being assigned has
	  some other pointer type defined as its argument, as gcc complains 
	  about casts from void * to X* via function arguments.
	  Fix some old K&R style function argument definitions.
	  Add noreturn gcc attribute to some functions, as appropriate.
	  Add unused gcc attribute to some functions (eg ones meant to help
	  while debugging)
	  Add guard defines to headers which were missing them.
	* command.c: (install_node) add const qualifier, still doesnt shut
	  up the warning though, because of the double pointer.
	  (cmp_node) ditto
	* keychain.c: (key_str2time) Add GET_LONG_RANGE() macro, derived 
	  fromn vty.h ones to fix some of the (long) < 0 warnings.
	* thread.c: (various) use thread_empty
	  (cpu_record_hash_key) should cast to uintptr_t, a stdint.h type
	* vty.h: Add VTY_GET_IPV4_ADDRESS and VTY_GET_IPV4_PREFIX so they
	  removed from ospfd/ospf_vty.h
	* zebra.h: Move definition of ZEBRA_PORT to here, to remove
	  dependence of lib on zebra/zserv.h

2005-05-06 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* sockunion.c: Fix warning message.

2005-05-03 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* stream.h: Add comment about the special zero-ing ability of
	  stream_put.
	  (stream_recvmsg, stream_write) should return ssize_t and size_t
	  respectively. Should both be extern linkage.
	  (stream_recvfrom) Stream aware wrapper around recvfrom, in style
	  of stream_read_try.
	* stream.c: (stream_recvfrom) new function, wrapper around recvfrom.
	  (stream_recvmsg, stream_write) ssize_t and size_t return values
	  
2005-04-27 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	Add wall-clock timing statistics to 'show thread cpu' output.
	* thread.h: Define struct rusage_t to contain wall-clock time
	  and cpu time.  Change GETRUSAGE macro to collect both pieces
	  of data.  Make appropriate changes to struct cpu_thread_history
	  to track CPU time and real time.  Change proto for
	  thread_consumed_time to return real and cpu time elapsed.
	  And declare a new global variable 'struct timeval recent_time'.
	* thread.c (struct timeval recent_time): New global timestamp variable.
	  (timeval_adjust): If timeout is negative, set to 0 (not 10
	  microseconds).  And remove upper bound of 1,000,000 seconds, since
	  this does not seem to make any sense (and it breaks
	  funcname_thread_add_timer_timeval).
	  (timeval_cmp): Should return long, not int.
	  (vty_out_cpu_thread_history): Show CPU time and real time.
	  (cpu_record_hash_print): Calculate totals for CPU and real time.
	  (cpu_record_print): Change 'show thread cpu' title to show CPU and
	  real time.
	  (thread_timer_remain_second): Put current time in global recent_time.
	  (funcname_thread_add_timer_timeval): Fix assert.  Replace 2-case
	  switch assignment with a ternary expression.  Use global recent_time
	  variable.  Fix use of timeval_adjust (previously, the value was not
	  actually being adjusted).
	  (thread_cancel): Add missing "break" statement in case
	  THREAD_BACKGROUND.
	  (thread_timer_wait): Use global recent_time value instead of calling
	  gettimeofday.  And there's no need to check for negative timeouts,
	  since timeval_subtract already sets these to zero.
	  (thread_timer_process): Timers are sorted, so bail out once we
	  encounter a timer that has not yet popped.  And remove some
	  extraneous asserts.
	  (thread_fetch): Do not process foreground timers before calling
	  select.  Instead, add them to the ready list just after the select.
	  Also, no need to maintain a count of the number of ready threads,
	  since we don't care how many there are, just whether there's
	  one at the head of the ready list (which is easily checked).
	  Stick current time in global variable recent_time to reduce
	  the number of calls to gettimeofday.  Tighten logic for
	  calculating the select timeout.
	  (thread_consumed_time): Now returns real time and puts the elapsed
	  cpu time in an additional argument.
	  (thread_should_yield): Use real (wall-clock) time to decide whether
	  to yield.
	  (thread_call): Maintain CPU and real time statistics.
	* vty.c (vty_command): For slow commands, show real and cpu time.

2005-04-27 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* workqueue.c (show_work_queues): Remove unused gettimeofday call.

2005-04-27 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* workqueue.h: (struct work_queue_item) change retry_count to ran,
	  its a count of number item has been run.
	* workqueue.c: (show_work_queues) Fix formating of slightly
	  bugfix: fix SIGFPE if wq->runs is 0.
	  (work_queue_run) retry logic was slightly wrong.
	  cycles.best is 0 initialy, granularity is 1, so update best
	  if cycles >= granularity, not just >.
	* memory.h: memtypes is built source, default includes points to
	  top_builddir, so we should refer to lib/memtypes.h

2005-04-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* buffer.c (buffer_write): Comment out call to buffer_flush_available.
	  This should speed up buffering at the expense of a possible increase
	  in latency in flushing the data if inside a long-running thread.

2005-04-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* workqueue.{c,h}: Helper API for setting up and running queues via
	  background threads.
	* command.c: install the 'show workqueues' command
	* memtypes.c: Add work queue mtypes, and a rib-queue type for
	  a zebra rib work queue.
	* memtypes.h: Updated to match memtypes.c
	* Makefile.am: Refer to source files via srcdir variable, fix
	  out-of-tree build breakage.
	  Add new workqueue files to build.
	* memory.c: Make the string field much wider
	* memtypes.c: Correct the prefix list str/entry strings
	* thread.c: Kill unused TIMER_NO_SORT bits

2005-04-22 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* thread.h: Fix type for struct thread_master add_type: should be
	  unsigned char.  Also, add some documentation of thread_add_background
	  args.  And remove extraneous declaration of
	  show_thread_work_queues_cmd.

2005-04-22 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* memory.h: Move include of memtypes.h to after the definition of
	  struct memory_list, gcc 4.0 doesn't like arrays of incomplete 
	  types.
	* thread.h: Add background thread type and thread_add_background
	  macro and accompanying funcname_... function.
	  export thread_should_yield, background threads can use it.
	  Lower thread yield time to 10ms, 100ms is noticeable lag and
	  a thread would only be /starting/ to finish sometime afterward.
	* thread.c: (general) Add background thread type and schedule
	  nearly all thread types through the ready list for fairness.
	  (timeval_adjust) static qualifier missing
	  (vty_out_cpu_thread_history) add support for printout of 
	  background threads
	  (show_thread_cpu) ditto.
	  (thread_master_debug) add debug of background list
	  (thread_master_create) fixup long line
	  (thread_add_unuse) add asserts for required state.
	  (thread_master_free) free background thread list
	  (funcname_thread_add_timer_timeval) make generic, able to 
	  support arbitrary timer-like thread types.
	  (funcname_thread_add_timer) pass thread type to .._add_timer_timeval
	  (funcname_thread_add_timer_msec) ditto
	  (funcname_thread_add_background) Add a background thread, with an
	  optional millisecond delay factor, using .._add_timer_timeval.
	  (thread_cancel) Add background thread type.
	  Move the thread_list_delete common to all cases to bottom of
	  function, after the switch statement..
	  (thread_cancel_event) indent
	  (thread_timer_wait) Static qualifier, and make it able to cope
	  with arbitrary timer-like thread lists, so its of use to
	  background threads too.
	  (thread_process_fd) static qualifier. Again, make it take a list
	  reference rather than thread_master. Fix indentation.
	  (thread_timer_process) Check for ready timer-like threads in the
	  given list and move them on to the ready list - code originally
	  embedded in thread_fetch.
	  (thread_fetch) Schedule all threads, other than events, through
	  the ready list, to ensure fairness. Timer readying code moved to
	  thread_timer_process so it can be reused for background threads.
	  Remove the unneeded quagga_sigevent_process, as pointed out by
	  John Lin <john.ch.lin@gmail.com>.
	  (thread_should_yield) make this available.
	
2005-04-16 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* thread.h (thread_consumed_time): Declare new function to calculate
	  elapsed microseconds.
	* thread.c (thread_consumed_time): Must be global not static so we
	  can call it from lib/vty.c:vty_command.
	  (thread_should_yield): Surround with `#if 0' to make clear that this
	  function is not currently being used anywhere.
	  (thread_call): If CONSUMED_TIME_CHECK is defined, print a CPU HOG
	  warning message if the thread takes more than CONSUMED_TIME_CHECK
	  microseconds.
	* vty.c (vty_command): If CONSUMED_TIME_CHECK is defined, print a CPU
	  HOG warning message if the command takes more than CONSUMED_TIME_CHECK
	  microseconds.

2005-04-16 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* memtypes.c: the comment about use of comments in the comments
	  headers was causing comment within comment warnings from compiler
	* memtypes.awk: Add extensive comments on the file format for
	  memtypes.c.
	  tighten the pattern for the MTYPE matching action (suggestion from
	  Andrew) and tighten which field we try the match on.

2005-04-15 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* memtypes.c: The new, unified location for memory type definitions.
	  The memtype enum and declarations for memory_lists are built from
          this automatically and put into memtypes.h.
        * memtypes.awk: New script to generate memtypes.h from memtypes.c
        * memory.h: Finally, the enum can banished!
        * memory.c: Finally, the seperate mtype memory_list definitions can
          be banished!
          (log_memstats) Increase width of fields
          (show_memory_zebra_cmd) display zebra specific memory types.
          Increase width of fields.
        * Makefile.am: Add memtypes.{c,h}, add BUILT_SOURCES for memtypes.h
          Add a rule to build memtypes.h using memtypes.awk.
          Add memtypes.awk to EXTRA_DIST.
	  memtypes.awk is gawk dependent, use the GAWK automake var.
	* memtypes.h: New file, auto-generated, checked in for convenience.

2005-04-11 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zclient.h (struct zclient): Add two fields to support non-blocking
	  I/O: struct buffer *wb, and struct thread *t_write.
	  (zclient_free): Remove function.
	  (zebra_redistribute_send): Change 2nd arg from socket fd to
	  struct zclient * (needed to support non-blocking I/O and buffering).
	  (zclient_send_message): New function to send an arbitrary
	  message with non-blocking I/O.
	* zclient.c (zclient_new): Create write buffer.
	  (zclient_free): Remove unused function.

	  (zclient_start): Set socket non-blocking.  Also, change 2nd arg
	  to zebra_redistribute_send from zclient->sock to zclient.
	  (zebra_redistribute_send): Change 2nd arg to struct zclient *.
	  Can now use zclient->obuf to assemble the message instead of
	  allocating a temporary stream.  And call zclient_send_message to
	  send the message instead of writen. 
	  (zclient_read): Convert to support non-blocking I/O by using
	  stream_read_try instead of deprecated stream_read.
	  (zclient_redistribute): Change 2nd arg to zebra_redistribute_send
	  from zclient->sock to zclient.

2005-04-09 Jeroen Simonetti <jeroens@office.netland.nl>

	* routemap.c: Show description in "show route-map" output.

2005-04-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sigevent.c: On GNU_LINUX, check whether __USE_GNU is already defined.

2005-04-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.c: (vty_log_fixed) Use casts to (void *) to try to eliminate
	  compiler warnings when assigning a (const char *) value to
	  struct iovec iov_base.

2005-04-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: If GNU_LINUX is defined, then define _GNU_SOURCE.  This
	  fixes a problem where we were not getting the declaration of strnlen
	  in <string.h>.

2005-04-08 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* routemap.[ch]: Added "description ..." command.

2005-04-08 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	  inet_ntoa alike.

2005-04-07 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* linklist.h: Add usage comments.	  
	  Rename getdata macro to listgetdata.
	  Rename nextnode to listnextnode and fix its odd behaviour to be
	  less dangerous.
	  Make listgetdata macro assert node is not null, NULL list entries
          should be bug condition.
          ALL_LIST_ELEMENTS, new macro, forward-referencing macro for use
          with for loop, Suggested by Jim Carlson of Sun.
          Add ALL_LIST_ELEMENTS_RO for cases which obviously do not need the
          "safety" of previous macro.
	  LISTNODE_ADD and DELETE macros renamed to ATTACH, DETACH, to
	  distinguish from the similarly named functions, and reflect their
	  effect better.
	  Add a QUAGGA_NO_DEPRECATED_INTERFACES define guarded section 
	  with the old defines which were modified above, 
	  for backwards compatibility - guarded to prevent Quagga using it..
	* linklist.c: fix up for linklist.h changes.
	* *.c: fix up for new list loop macro, try audit other loop
          usage at same time, to some degree.

2004-04-05 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* lib/prefix.[hc]: inet6_ntoa utility function copied from
	  ripngd/ripngd.c (inet6_ntop).

2004-04-05 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* vty.c: Improve logging of failures to open vty socket(s).
	  See bugid #163.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: Fix comments to reflect that if_lookup_by_name and
	  if_get_by_name now require the argument strings to be NUL-terminated.
	* if.c: (if_lookup_by_name) Compare using strcmp.
	  (if_get_by_name) Pass strlen(ifname) as 2nd arg to if_create.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.c: (if_nametoindex) The man page is rather vague, but it seems
	  like the argument to if_nametoindex has an implicit maximum length
	  of IFNAMSIZ characters.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: (if_lookup_by_name_len, if_get_by_name_len) New functions.
	* if.c: (if_lookup_by_name_len, if_get_by_name_len) New functions.
	  (if_get_by_name) Tighten up code.
	  (interface) Use new function if_get_by_name_len.
	* zclient.c: (zebra_interface_add_read) Use new if_get_by_name_len
	  function.
	  (zebra_interface_state_read) Use new if_lookup_by_name_len function.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* str.c: Replace strlcpy and strlcat with actual working versions
	  copied from rsync-2.6.2/lib/compat.c.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: Remove define for IFINDEX_INTERNBASE and add define
	  IFINDEX_INTERNAL 0, since all internal (i.e. non-kernel) pseudo-
	  interfaces should have ifindex set to 0.
	  (if_new) Remove function.
	  (if_delete_retain) New function to delete an interface without
	  removing from iflist and freeing the structure.
	  (ifname2ifindex) New function.
	* if.c: (if_new) Remove function (absorb into if_create).
	  (if_create) Replace function if_new with call to calloc.
	  Set ifp->ifindex to IFINDEX_INTERNAL.  Fix off-by-one error
	  in assert to check length of interface name.  Add error message
	  if interface with this name already exists.
	  (if_delete_retain) New function to delete an interface without
	  removing from iflist and freeing the structure.
	  (if_delete) Implement with help of if_delete_retain.
	  (ifindex2ifname) Reimplement using if_lookup_by_index.
	  (ifname2ifindex) New function to complement ifindex2ifname.
	  (interface) The interface command should check the name length
	  and fail with a warning message if it is too long.
	  (no_interface) Fix spelling in warning message.
	  (if_nametoindex) Reimplement using if_lookup_by_name.
	  (if_indextoname, ifaddr_ipv4_lookup) Reimplement using
	  if_lookup_by_index.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: Should include str.h to pick up missing functions.
	* str.h: Declare strnlen if needed.
	* str.c: Do not include str.h since zebra.h now includes it.
	  (strnlen) New function.

2005-03-16 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: Must check whether __attribute__ should be defined before
	  including zassert.h.

2005-03-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.c: (sort_node) use vector_max instead of referencing 
	  (struct vector *)->max directly. Test that vector_max is > 0 
	  before using it to calculate an index.
	  Fixup vector loop to make main body conditional on vector slot
	  not being empty.
	  (cmd_cmdsize) Fixup vector loop to make main body conditional on
	  vector slot not being empty.
	  (cmd_filter_by_completion) ditto
	  (cmd_filter_by_string) ditto 
	  (is_cmd_ambiguous) ditto
	  (cmd_describe_command_real) Change index integers to unsigned.
	  Test that vector_max is > 0 before using it to calculate an index.
	  Return immediately with CMD_ERR_NO_MATCH if vline has no 
	  active slots.
	  Fixup vector loop to make main body conditional on vector slot
	  not being empty.
	  (cmd_complete_command_real) ditto.
	  (cmd_execute_command_strict) Fixup vector loop to be conditional
	  on non-null slot.
	  (various) Fix indentation and other whitespace.
	  vector.h: Rename to (struct vector).max to slightly less confusing
	  active, for the number of active slots, distinct from allocated
	  or active-and-not-empty. Rename vector_max to vector_active 
	  for same reason.

2005-03-09 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.c: Undo commit of sign warning fix and hidden command
	  in list_cmd. Sign warning is more subtle. list_cmd on its own
	  will be committed after.
	* command.c: (config_list_cmd) Don't list hidden or deprecated
	  commands, hiding these from tab completion is still to be done.

2005-03-08 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* command.c: (banner_motd_file_cmd) use XSTRDUP/XFREE.
	  (no_banner_motd_cmd) use XFREE.
	  (cmd_describe_command_real) sign compile warning fix
	  (cmd_complete_command_real) ditto.
	  (config_list_cmd) Don't list hidden or deprecated commands,
	  hiding these from tab completion is still to be done.
	* command.h: cmd attr enum should start at 1.
	* vty.c: (vty_hello) suggestions from Andrew, read by line and
	  stub out trailling non-printable characters on each line thus
	  allowing us to specify VTY_NEWLINE to vty_out.

2005-03-08 Jeroen Massar <jeroen@unfix.org>

	* vty.c: (vty_hello) display motd file, if set
	* command.h: add char *motdfile to struct host
	* command.c: (config_write_host) write out motdfile config
	  (banner_motd_file_cmd) new command, allow motd to be read from
	  file.
	  (no_banner_motd_cmd) free motdfile string, if needs be.
	  (cmd_init) init (struct host).motdfile. Add new motd file
	  commands.

2005-03-07 Michael Sandee <voidptr@voidptr.sboost.org>

	* command.c: host.name might be NULL.
	* vty.c: Fix fd leak.

2005-02-24 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* stream.c: (stream_read_try) Log a warning message if a fatal
	  I/O error occurs.
	  (stream_fifo_new) Fix prototype.
	* stream.h: Fix prototype for stream_fifo_new (need void arg).

2005-02-23 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* {vty.h,vty.c}: Remove vty_finish (duplicate of vty_reset).

2005-02-23 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* buffer.h: Make the struct buffer and struct buffer_data structures
	  private by moving them inside buffer.c.  Add comments for all
	  functions.  Rename buffer_write as buffer_put (to be more consistent
	  with the buffer_putc and buffer_putstr functions).  Declare a new
	  buffer_write function that is used to write data to a file descriptor
	  and/or add it to the buffer queue.  Remove unused function
	  buffer_flush_vty_all.  Create a new enum typedef buffer_status_t
	  to be used as the return code for all buffer_flush* functions
	  and buffer_write.
	* buffer.c: The struct buffer and struct buffer_data declarations
	  are now private to this file.  In conjunction with that, remove
	  some unnecessary fields: struct buffer (alloc, unused_head,
	  unused_tail, length), struct buffer_data (prev).
	  (buffer_data_new) Removed: functionality incorporated into buffer_add.
	  (buffer_data_free) Removed: use a macro BUFFER_DATA_FREE instead.
	  (buffer_new) Use calloc instead of malloc + memset(zero). 
	  Supply an appropriate default size if the specified size is 0.
	  (buffer_free) Eliminate code duplication by calling buffer_reset to
	  free the contents of the buffer (and remove unused code related
	  to unused_head).
	  (buffer_empty,buffer_putc,buffer_putstr) Aesthetic change (make more
	  compact).
	  (buffer_reset) Use macro BUFFER_DATA_FREE.  No need to set
	  alloc and length to 0 (these fields have been removed).
	  (buffer_add) Fix scope to be static.  Call XMALLOC directly instead
	  of calling removed buffer_data_new function.  Simplify the logic
	  (since it's now a singly-linked list instead of doubly-linked).
	  (buffer_write) Renamed to buffer_put.  Change to void, since return
	  code of 1 was meaningless.  No need to adjust length field, since
	  it has been removed.
	  (buffer_putw,buffer_flush,buffer_flush_vty_all,buffer_flush_vty)
	  Remove unused functions.
	  (buffer_flush_all) Rewrite using buffer_flush_available to eliminate
	  a possible failure mode if IOV_MAX is less than the number of buffers
	  on the queue.
	  (buffer_flush_window) Incorporate logic from buffer_flush_vty.
	  Log an error message if there is a writev error.
	  (buffer_flush_available) Be more paranoid: check for case where
	  buffer is already empty.  Use new ERRNO_IO_RETRY macro, and use
	  new enum for return codes.  Simplify deletion logic (since it's
	  now a singly-linked list).
	  (buffer_write) New function for use with non-blocking I/O.
	* vty.h: Replace the struct vty sb_buffer field with a fixed-size
	  (5-character) sb_buf field and an sb_len field, since using
	  a struct buffer was inappropriate for this task.  Add some useful
	  comments about telnet window size negotiation.
	* vty.c: Include <arpa/telnet.h> (no longer included by zebra.h).
	  Remove VTY_OBUF_SIZE (instead use buffer_new default size).
	  Make telnet_backward_char and telnet_space_char static const.
	  (vty_out) Replace buffer_write with buffer_put.
	  (vty_log_out) Check for I/O errors.  If fatal, close the vty session.
	  Consolidate 3 separate writes into a single write call.
	  (vty_will_echo,vty_command,vty_next_line,vty_previous_line,
	  vty_end_config,vty_describe_fold,vty_clear_buf,vty_serv_sock_addrinfo,
	  vty_serv_sock_family,vty_serv_un,vty_use_backup_config,exec_timeout,
	  vty_config_write,vty_save_cwd) Fix scope to static.
	  (vty_new) Let buffer_new use its default buffer size.
	  (vty_write) Fix signature: 2nd arg should be const char *.
	  Replaced buffer_write with buffer_put.
	  (vty_telnet_option) Fix minor bug (window height or width greater than
	  255 was broken).  Use sb_buf and sb_len instead of removed sb_buffer
	  (which was being used improperly).
	  (vty_read) On error, use ERRNO_IO_RETRY to decide whether it's fatal.
	  If the error is fatal, call buffer_reset so vty_close does not attempt
	  to flush the data.  Use new sb_buf and sb_len instead of sb_buffer
	  to store the SB negotiation string.
	  (vty_flush) When vty->lines is 0, call buffer_flush_available instead
	  of buffer_flush_window.  Look at the return code from buffer_flush
	  to detect I/O errors (and in that case, log an error message and
	  close the vty).
	  (vty_create) Fix scope to static.  Initialize sb_len to 0 instead
	  of creating sb_buffer.
	  (vty_accept) Set socket nonblocking.
	  (vtysh_accept) Use new set_nonblocking function instead of calling
	  fcntl directly.
	  (vtysh_flush) New function called from vtysh_read (after command
	  execution) and from vtysh_write.  This flushes the buffer
	  and reacts appropriately to the return code (by closing the vty
	  or scheduling further flushes).
	  (vtysh_read) Check whether error is fatal using ERRNO_IO_RETRY.
	  If not, just try again later.  Otherwise, call buffer_reset before
	  calling vty_close (to avoid trying to flush the buffer in vty_close).
	  Fix logic to allow case where a command does not arrive atomically
	  in a single read call by checking for the terminating NUL char.
	  (vtysh_write) Use new vtysh_flush helper function.
	  (vty_close) No need to call buffer_empty, just call buffer_flush_all
	  in any case (it will check whether the buffer is empty).
	  Do not free sb_buffer (since it has been removed).
	  (vty_log_fixed) Use writev instead of write.
	* zebra.h: Do not include <arpa/telnet.h>, since this is used only
	  by lib/vty.c.

2005-02-21 Vincenzo Eramo <eramo at infocom.ing.uniroma1.it>

	* pqueue.[ch]: Introduce "update" function to meet ospf spf needs. It
	  will allow to update node when:
	  i) a node is inserted into the priority queue;
	  ii) a node position is modified in the priority queue;
	* pqueue.h: Export trickle_down() function.

2005-02-19 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* stream.c: (stream_new) fix dumb mistake.

2005-02-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* stream.c: (stream_read_try) Use new ERRNO_IO_RETRY macro.

2005-02-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* network.h: Define a new ERRNO_IO_RETRY macro to test whether an I/O
	  operation should be retried.  This eliminates the need to duplicate
	  the same logic testing for EAGAIN or EINTR in multiple places.

2005-02-16 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* stream.h: Declare new function stream_read_try suitable for use
	  with non-blocking file descriptors.  Indicate that stream_read
	  and stream_read_unblock are deprecated.
	* stream.c: (stream_read_try) New function for use with non-blocking
	  I/O.
	  (stream_recvmsg) Should return -1 if the stream is too small to
	  contain the data.

2005-02-16 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* network.c: (set_nonblocking) Should check return code from
	  fcntl(F_GETFL).

2005-02-15 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>
	
	* network.h: Declare new function set_nonblocking.  Indicate that
	  readn and writen are deprecated.
	* network.c: (set_nonblocking) New function to make a file descriptor
	  non-blocking, since it seems silly to have fcntl calls sprinkled
	  throughout the code.

2005-02-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* stream.h: Unsigned long updated to size_t
	* stream.c: ditto
	* stream.h: Add stream_copy, stream_dup, stream_recvmsg.
	  Add comment describing struct stream abstraction, and various
	  other comments.
	  Deprecate several unsafe/ambigious macros.
	  Add STREAM_WRITEABLE and STREAM_READABLE.
	  Add (stream_getl_from) for symmetry.
	  Update stream_forward_{endp,getp} to use size_t offset.
	  Make stream data a 0 length array, rather than a seperate malloc.
	* stream.c: Add consistency checks. Update to follow stream.h
	  changes.
	  (stream_new) Alloc stream+data in one go.
	  (stream_copy) new function, copy a stream.
	  (stream_dup) new function, dup a stream.
	  (stream_recvmsg) new function, recvmsg data into a stream.
	  (stream_empty) no need to check getp == 0.

2005-02-09 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* stream.h: Remove putp. Update reference to putp with endp.
	  Add stream_forward_endp, which daemons were doing manually.
	  Rename stream_forward to stream_forward_getp.
	  stream.c: Remove/update references to putp.
	  introduce stream_forward_endp.

2005-02-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: Change macro definitions SET_FLAG and UNSET_FLAG
	  to use compound assignment operators (aesthetic change).

2005-02-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (zlog_signal,zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) Eliminate use of fileno()
	  since it is not async-signal-safe.
	  (_zlog_assert_failed) Rewrite crashlog logic more compactly.
	  (zlog_set_file,zlog_reset_file,zlog_rotate) Update logfile_fd
	  for use in signal handler.

2005-02-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (syslog_sigsafe) Reduce scope of syslog_fd: it is accessed
	  inside this function only.
	  (open_crashlog) New function to open /var/tmp/quagga.<daemon>.crashlog
	  with flags O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL to save some crash info.
	  (zlog_signal,_zlog_assert_failed) Increase logging priority from
	  LOG_ERR to LOG_CRIT.  If no file logging is configured, try to use
	  open_crashlog to create a crash logfile.
	  (zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) If a crashlog file descriptor is open,
	  dump a backtrace to that file.

2005-02-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* if.h: Declare if_flag_dump.

2005-01-30 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* daemon.c: (daemon) Replace perror with zlog_err.
	* vty.c: (vty_serv_un) Replace perror with zlog_err.

2005-01-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* buffer.h: Fix comment on buffer_getstr to reflect that it now
	  uses XMALLOC.
	* buffer.c: (buffer_getstr) Use XMALLOC(MTYPE_TMP) instead of malloc.
	* filter.c: (access_list_remark,ipv6_access_list_remark) Use
	  argv_concat instead of buffer_getstr.
	* if.c: (interface_desc) Use argv_concat instead of buffer_getstr.
	* plist.c: (ip_prefix_list_description,ipv6_prefix_list_description)
	  Use argv_concat instead of buffer_getstr.

2005-01-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* lib/buffer.h: Document behavior of buffer_getstr function.
	* lib/buffer.c: (buffer_getstr) Fix bug: must handle case where
	  the string extends beyond the head struct buffer_data.

2005-01-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* lib/command.h: Document behavior of argv_concat function.
	* lib/command.c: (argv_concat) Calculate total string length first so
	  we can call malloc just once (instead of realloc'ing to add each
	  string element).
	  (do_echo,config_logmsg) Allow for possible NULL return value from
	  argv_concat.

2005-01-23 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* lib/command.[ch]: Make node_parent() function nonstatic. vtyh.c will
	  use it as well.

2005-01-18 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.h: Test for SA_SIGINFO to see whether zlog_signal takes final
	  two args (siginfo and program_counter).
	* log.c: (hex_append) Include this function only if SA_SIGINFO or
	  HAVE_GLIBC_BACKTRACE is defined.
	  (zlog_signal) Final two args (siginfo and program_counter) now
	  depend on whether SA_SIGINFO is defined on this platform.
	* sigevent.c: (program_counter) Do not include this function if
	  SA_SIGINFO is not defined on this platform.
	  (exit_handler,core_handler) Test for SA_SIGINFO to decide whether
	  2nd & 3rd arguments are present and to decide how to invoke
	  zlog_signal.
	  (trap_default_signals) Test for SA_SIGINFO and invoke sigaction
	  appropriately.

2005-01-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.h: Change prototype for zlog_backtrace_sigsafe to take additional
	  program_counter argument.
	* log.c: (zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) Add additional program_counter
	  argument.  If it is non-NULL, use backtrace_symbols_fd to resolve
	  the address.
	  (zlog_signal) Call zlog_backtrace_sigsafe with additional
	  program_counter argument.

2005-01-17 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* command.[ch], vty.c: cmd_execute_command() function must not attempt
	  to walk up in the node tree if called from vtysh. Different daemons
	  might have commands with same syntax in different nodes (for example
	  "router-id x.x.x.x" commands in zebra/ospfd/ospf6d daemons).

2005-01-14 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* command.c (print_version): Do not bother even to examine host.name,
	  since it is always NULL when this function is called from main.

2005-01-14  Greg Troxel  <gdt@fnord.ir.bbn.com>

	* command.c (print_version): Don't print host.name if it is NULL.
	Fixes segfault on Solaris reported by Goetz von Escher <goetz@open.ch>
	
2005-01-12 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sigevent.c: (trap_default_signals) Use the SA_SIGINFO flag to
	  pass additional siginfo_t and ucontext_t arguments to core_handler
	  and exit_handler.
	  (core_handler,exit_handler) Now invoked with 3 arguments (using
	  SA_SIGINFO).  Pass additional info to zlog_signal.
	  (program_counter) New function to find program counter in ucontext_t,
	  needs to be enhanced to support more platforms (currently works only
	  on Linux/x86).
	* log.h: Change the zlog_signal prototype to add new arguments
	  siginfo_t * and program_counter.
	* log.c: (zlog_signal) Add new arguments siginfo and program_counter.
	  Include si_addr and program counter (if non-NULL) in message.
	  And remove #ifdef HAVE_GLIBC_BACKTRACE around hex_append, since
	  that is now used to render the si_addr and PC pointers.

2005-01-12 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: If not C99 and no va_copy macro available, fall back to
	  memcpy (solves a build problem on FreeBSD 4.x).

2005-01-04 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: Define ZCMSG_FIRSTHDR appropriately based on whether
	  config.h indicates HAVE_BROKEN_CMSG_FIRSTHDR (as determined
	  by the configure test program).
	* sockopt.c: (getsockopt_cmsg_data) Use ZCMSG_FIRSTHDR instead
	  of CMSG_FIRSTHDR.

2005-01-02 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* command.c: Revert int -> unsigned int fixes in
	cmd_describe_command_real() and cmd_complete_command_real(). index can
	be actually negative and it caused crash with "do<TAB>" in vty.

2004-12-29  Greg Troxel  <gdt@poblano.ir.bbn.com>

	* sockopt.c (getsockopt_ipv4_ifindex): Document calling
	convention.  Beef up comments.  Handle the case where the cmsghdr
	has a zero controllen, or more specifically when the wanted option
	is not present.  This is needed for Solaris 8, and in general for
	any platform for which configure finds a method and it can fail.
	Mark some changes with XXX to be cleaned up post 0.98.	
	
2004-12-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sockopt.c: (setsockopt_ipv4_ifindex) Improve error message.
	  When neither IP_PKTINFO nor IP_RECVIF is defined, make return value
	  deterministic (-1).

2004-12-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* thread.c: (funcname_thread_add_timer_msec) Reduce overflow risk.

2004-12-21 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* if.h: Add more 'non-generic' IFF_ flags.
	* if.c: IFF_NOXMIT/IFF_VIRTUAL interfaces are 'loopback like'
	* stream.c: Dont allocate streams with 0 sized data buffers

2004-12-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* command.c: (do_echo) Added new "echo" command, useful for
	  watchdog pinging to make sure the daemon is responsive.

2004-12-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>
	
	* pid_output.c: (pid_output_lock) Eliminate static function, and just
	  use the #ifdef to decide which version of the function to include.
	  This eliminates a compilation problem with gcc4.  And fix the
	  non-fcntl version so that it actually compiles.  Exit with
	  status 1 instead of -1 on error.

2004-12-15 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* sigevent.c: (trap_default_signals) Ignore SIGPIPE instead of exiting.

2004-12-10 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>
	
	* log.c: (zlog_signal,_zlog_assert_failed) Change logging level back to
	  LOG_ERR instead of LOG_EMERG.

2004-12-09 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (hex_append) No need to include this function if
	  HAVE_GLIBC_BACKTRACE is not defined.

2004-12-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* prefix.c: (prefix_copy) Error message before abort should
	  have severity LOG_ERR, not LOG_INFO.
	* memory.c: (mtype_log) Log level should be LOG_DEBUG, not LOG_INFO.

2004-12-07 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* {smux.c,zclient.c}: Change level of debug messages to LOG_DEBUG.

2004-12-07 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* command.c: (config_write_host) Note that "log trap" is deprecated
	  when writing out the config.

2004-12-07 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.h: Replace struct zlog flags and maskpri fields with maxlvl
	  array to support individual logging levels for each destination.
	  Remove the 2nd argument to openzlog since the default logging config
	  should be standardized inside the library.  Replaced the
	  zlog_set_flag and zlog_reset_flag functions with zlog_set_level.
	  And zlog_set_file now requires an additional log_level argument.
	  Declare zlog_proto_names for use inside command.c in the
	  "show logging" command.  Added defines useful for command
	  construction.
	* log.c: (vzlog) Decide where to send the message based on the
	  individual logging levels configured for each destination.
	  Remove support for ZLOG_STDERR since it was never actually used.
	  Support record-priority for terminal monitors.
	  (zlog_signal,zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) Support destination-specific
	  logging levels.  Remove stderr support (was never used).  Added
	  support for terminal monitor logging.
	  (_zlog_assert_failed) Increase message severity to LOG_EMERG.
	  (openzlog) Remove 2nd argument since default config should be
	  standardized in library.  By default, terminal monitoring
	  is set to debug, and all other logging is disabled.
	  (zlog_set_flag,zlog_reset_flag) Removed.
	  (zlog_set_level) New function to replace zlog_set_flag and
	  zlog_reset_flag.  Supports destination-specific logging levels.
	  (zlog_set_file,zlog_reset_file) Support file-specific logging level.
	  (zlog_rotate) Log an error message if fopen fails, and support
	  new file-specific logging level.
	* command.h: Change DEFUN_CMD_FUNC_DECL and DEFUN_CMD_FUNC_TEXT so that
	  command functions will be static instead of global.  Remove
	  declarations for config_exit and config_help.  Define new macros
	  DEFUNSH_ATTR, DEFUNSH_HIDDEN, and DEFUNSH_DEPRECATED so we can
	  have deprecated commands in vtysh.  Similarly, for completeness,
	  define macros ALIAS_SH, ALIAS_SH_HIDDEN, and ALIAS_SH_DEPRECATED.
	  Also, fix bug in ALIAS_ATTR macro (didn't matter because it
	  was never used).
	* command.c: Make many functions static instead of global.
	  (facility_name,facility_match,level_match) New functions
	  to support enhanced destination-specific logging levels.
	  (config_write_host) Support new destination-specific logging levels.
	  (config_logmsg) Added new "logmsg" command to help test logging
	  system.
	  (show_logging) Added "show logging" command to show the current
	  configuration of the logging system.
	  (config_log_stdout_level) Support explicit stdout logging level.
	  (no_config_log_stdout) Now takes optional LEVEL arg.
	  (config_log_monitor,config_log_monitor_level,no_config_log_monitor)
	  New commands creating new "log monitor" commands to set terminal
	  monitoring log level.
	  (config_log_file_level) Support explicit file logging level.
	  (config_log_syslog_level) Support explicit syslog logging level.
	  (config_log_facility,no_config_log_facility) Implement new
	  "log facility" command.
	  (cmd_init) Add hooks for new commands: "show logging", "logmsg",
	  "log stdout <level>", "log monitor", "log monitor <level>",
	  "no log monitor", "log file <filename> <level>",
	  "no log file <filename> <level>", "log syslog <level>",
	  "log facility", and "no log facility".
	* vty.h: Added a "level" argument to vty_log so it can support
	  "log record-priority".  Declare new function vty_log_fixed for
	  use in signal handlers.
	* vty.c: (vty_log,vty_log_out) Added a "level" argument to support
	  "log record-priority" for vty terminal monitors.
	  (vty_down_level) Use config_exit_cmd.func instead of calling
	  config_exit directly (since command functions will now be static
	  instead of global).
	  (vty_log_fixed) New function to send terminal monitor messages
	  from inside a signal handler.

2004-12-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.h: Document appropriate use of syslog logging priorities
	  inside quagga.

2004-12-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* command.h: Remove fields log_stdout and log_syslog from struct host,
	  since they are just trying to duplicate information in the
	  zlog_default structure.  Note that this fixes a bug since those
	  fields were not registering any logging that was established
	  in the initial call to openzlog (this affects only the zebra and
	  ospf6d daemons).  It is probably a bug to turn on any logging by
	  default in the call to openzlog.
	* command.c: (config_write_host) Get logging info from zlog_default
	  instead of now-removed fields host.log_stdout and host.log_syslog.
	  (config_log_stdout,no_config_log_stdout) Do not set now-removed field
	  host.log_stdout, since this info is recorded in zlog_default.
	  (config_log_file) Use XSTRDUP (instead of strdup) to set host.logfile.
	  (config_log_syslog,config_log_syslog_facility,no_config_log_syslog)
	  Do not set now-removed field host.log_syslog, since this info is
	  recorded in zlog_default.

2004-12-03 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* version.h.in: Remove declaration for pid_output_lock, this function
	  is now static, not global.
	* pid_output.c: (pid_output_lock) This function should be static, not
	  global.  And remove "old umask" error message, since it was really
	  an unimportant debug message, not an error.
	  (pid_output) Need to declare static function pid_output_lock.

2004-11-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.h: Remove several unused fields from struct zlog.  Add comments
	  for other fields, and add one new field syslog_options that is
	  used in the new syslog_sigsafe implementation.
	* log.c: (syslog_sigsafe) New function to send syslog messages in
	  an async-signal safe way that can be used inside a signal handler.
	  (syslog_connect) New function to connect to syslog daemon inside a
	  signal handler.  This function supports only systems where /dev/log
	  is a unix datagram socket (e.g. not Solaris).
	  (zlog_signal) Call syslog_sigsafe if syslog logging is enabled.
	  (zlog_backtrace_sigsafe) Call syslog_sigsafe if syslog logging is
	  enabled.
	  (openzlog) Save syslog_options for use in syslog_sigsafe.
	  (num_append) Fix bug: handle 0 properly.
	  (hex_append) New function to print a u_long in hex format.

2004-11-28 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* command.h: DEFUN_DEPRECATED passes attribute to DEFUN as well.

2004-11-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (zlog_backtrace) New function to log a backtrace.
	  (zlog_backtrace_safe) Log a backtrace in an async-signal-safe way.
	  Unfortunately, this function does not support syslog logging yet.
	  (zlog_signal) Move backtrace code into separate function
	  zlog_backtrace_safe.
	  (_zlog_assert_failed) Call zlog_backtrace before aborting.
	* log.h: Declare new functions zlog_backtrace and zlog_backtrace_safe.
	* memory.c: (zerror) Call zlog_backtrace before aborting.

2004-11-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

2004-11-25 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zebra.h: If not C99 and there's no va_copy macro and there is
	  a __va_copy macro, define va_copy as __va_copy.

2004-11-25 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* pid_output.c: (pid_output_lock) Fix 2 bugs: when locking, should
	  set l_whence to SEEK_SET, not SEEK_END.  And after writing new
	  pid to file, must ftruncate to eliminate any extraneous bytes left
	  over from the last time a pid was written.

2004-11-24 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* zassert.h: New header file to declare a quagga-specific assert macro.
	* log.c: (_zlog_assert_failed) New function called when assert fails
	  to log the error and abort.
	* zebra.h: Include "zassert.h" instead of <assert.h>.
	* regex.c: Include "zassert.h" instead of <assert.h>.

2004-11-23 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	  so that processes will issue an error message before terminating
	  or dumping core.
	  (trap_default_signals) New function to set up signal handlers
	  for various signals that may kill the process.
	  (exit_handler) Call zlog_signal, then _exit.
	  (core_handler) Call zlog_signal, then abort.
	* log.h: Declare new function zlog_signal.
	* log.c: (zlog_signal) New function to log information about
	  a received signal before the process dies.  Try to log a 
	  backtrace also.
	  (quagga_signal_handler,signal_set) Should be static.

2004-11-23 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* log.c: (vzlog) Take a single va_list argument and use va_copy
	  as necessary for multiple traversals.
	  (zlog) Pass only one va_list to vzlog.
	  (zlog_*,plog_*) Use a macro for boilerplate code; pass only one
	  va_list to vzlog.

	  properly.
	  (vty_log) Must use va_copy for multiple traversals of va_list arg.

2004-11-19 David Young <dyoung@pobox.com>

	  of global.  Fix prototype for memory_init().

2004-11-15  Greg Troxel  <gdt@fnord.ir.bbn.com>

	* sockopt.h: Avoid CMSG_ALIGN, and declare that sizes are without
	alignment (users should use CMSG_SPACE).

	* zebra.h: Rationalize CMSG_SPACE compatibility defines.  Warn if
	asumming 4-byte alignment, since this isn't safe.

2004-11-15 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* memory.c: (zerror) Use zlog_err instead of fprintf to stderr.
	  Instead of exiting, log currenty memory usage and then abort.
	  (log_memstats) New function to log memory statistics, called by
	  zerror.

	  show_memory_vty separately for each memory_list.

2004-11-08 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* buffer.c: Add missing include of log.h.
	  (buffer_flush_available) written is compared against
	  mostly against unsigned types, only for the writev do we need
          signed compare, so declare it as size_t and cast it to ssize_t
          just for the error compare when we've called writev.
	* buffer.h: Add comment that buffer data sizes really should be 
          size_t.

2004-11-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* version.h.in: add autoconf configure_input output var

2004-11-04 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.h: Remove fields in struct vty that were related to VTY_CONTINUE
	  capabilities (that were used only in bgpd/bgp_route.c and are now
	  removed).  Also remove some other fields that were not being
	  used at all.
	* vty.c: (vty_execute) Do not test for obsolete status values VTY_START
	  and VTY_CONTINUE.
	  (vty_read) Remove calls to vty->output_func since that was part
	  of the VTY_CONTINUE infrastructure that has been removed.
	  (vty_flush) Remove code to support VTY_START and VTY_CONTINUE.
	  (vty_close) Remove code to cancel vty->t_output thread, since that
	  thread was never actually used.

2004-11-04 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* vty.c: Vtysh connections to daemons should use buffering.

	  call buffer_flush_available and schedule further writes if the
	  buffers are not yet empty.
	  (vtysh_write) New function to flush output to vtysh when the socket
	  is writeable.
	  (vty_event) Added new VTYSH_WRITE event for flushing buffers to vtysh
	  clients.  Also, should save read thread in vty->t_read so the
	  thread can be cancelled in vty_close.
	* buffer.h: In struct buffer_data, remove unused "parent" field.
	  Convert "unsigned char *data" to "unsigned char data[0]" to save
	  a malloc.  Declare new function buffer_flush_available that works
	  with non-blocking sockets.
	* buffer.c: (buffer_data_new) Use a single malloc now that data is
	  a variable-size array at end of structure.
	  (buffer_data_free) Just a single free now that data is part of the

	* memory.h: Add MTYPE_THREAD_FUNCNAME and MTYPE_THREAD_STATS
	* thread.c: Update stats and funcname alloc/free to use previous
	  specific memory type defines. Use XCALLOC and sizeof the type,
          not the pointer.
	* smux.c: fix int to size_t compile warnings

2004-10-29 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* vty.c: Move setting of sock to O_NONBLOCK from vty_serv_un
	  to vtysh_accept, where sock is the actual fd we wanted to set to
          O_NONBLOCK, ie the /connected/ vtysh unix socket.

2004-10-23 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	blocker bugzilla #109.

2004-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

          -1. 
          (setsockopt_pktinfo) unexported
	* sockopt.h: Cleanup SOCKOPT_CMSG defines a bit. Add a throwaway
          define for SOPT_SIZE_CMSG_IFINDEX_IPV4 for systems which have
          neither IP_RECVIF nor IP_PKTINFO (eg openbsd), thanks to Rivo
          Nurges for highlighting problem and fix.
          Fix elif that should be an else.
	* command.h: Cleanup the defines a bit, add helper defines and
	  collapse all defines to use those. Add an attribute field to
	  cmd_element to support, eg hidden or deprecated commands, add
          defun defines for such. All that's left to do is add logic
          to command.c to check these attributes... ;)
	* zebra.h: reserve ZEBRA_ROUTE_HSLS

2004-10-19 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* version.h.in: Define copyright string QUAGGA_COPYRIGHT.
	* print_version.c: Remove. print_version () function moved to
	  command.[c|h].
	* command.c: Use QUAGGA_COPYRIGHT.
	* Makefile.am: Remove useless version.c and print_version.c files.

2004-10-19 Andrew J. Schorr <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* zclient.c: (zebra_interface_address_read) If the destination address
	  is encoded as all zeroes, load it as a NULL pointer.
	* if.h: Add comment describing struct connected destination field
	  and indicating that it may be NULL.  Define macros
	  CONNECTED_DEST_HOST and CONNECTED_POINTOPOINT_HOST to help
	  with PtP logic (distinguish between host and subnet addressing).
	* if.c: (if_lookup_address) Fix PtP logic to handle subnet addressing
	  properly,
	  (connected_lookup_address) ditto.
	  (connected_add_by_prefix) Handle case where destination is NULL,

2004-10-13 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* command.c: Make CMD_ERR_NOTHING_TODO nonfatal if reading
	  configuration from file. Fixes critical bugzilla #113.
	* smux.c, smux.h: Remove all defaults to initialize smux connection to
	  snmpd by default even if not configured to do so. "smux peer OID
	  <password>" initializes now connection and "no smux peer" terminates
	  it.

2004-10-13 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* (global) more const'ification.
	* sockunion.c: (sockunion_su2str) buffer should be sized
          SU_ADDRSTRLEN.
          (sockunion_log) do not return stack variables, strdup buf before
          return.
        * vty.h: Fix up the VTY_GET_INTEGER macros. Testing caller supplied
          values against ULONG_MAX is daft, when caller probably has passed
          a type that can not hold ULONG_MAX. use a temporary long instead.
          Add VTY_GET_LONG, make VTY_GET_INTEGER_RANGE use it, make
	  VTY_GET_INTEGER a define for VTY_GET_INTEGER_RANGE.

2004-10-11 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* command.h: Sync DEFUNSH with other macros.

	* version.h.in: (pid_output*) add const qualifier.
	* command.h: Change DEFUN func to take const char *[] rather
          than char **, to begin process of fixing compile warnings in lib/.
          Nearly all other changes in this commit follow from this change.
        * buffer.{c,h}: (buffer_write) pointer-arithmetic is gccism, take
          const void * and cast an automatic const char *p to it.
          (buffer_putstr) add const
        * command.c: (zencrypt) const qualifier
          (cmd_execute_command_real) ditto

          Fix leak of getcwd() returned string.
        * memory.{c,h}: Add MTYPE_DISTRIBUTE_IFNAME for struct dist ifname.
        * distribute.{c,h}: Update with const qualifier.
          (distribute_free) use MTYPE_DISTRIBUTE_IFNAME

          (if_rmap_lookup) Cast to char *, note that it's ok.
          (if_rmap_get) ditto.
        * log.{c,h}: Update with const qualifier.
        * plist.{c,h}: ditto.
        * routemap.{c,h}: ditto.
        * smux.{c,h}: ditto. Fix some signed/unsigned comparisons.
        * sockopt.c: (getsockopt_cmsg_data) add return for error case.
        * vty.c: Update with const qualifier.
          
2004-10-08 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* routemap.c, routemap.h: Make some string arguments const.
