 *     if (error)
 *       break;         -- break can be used to get out of the block
 *     ... code ...
 *   }
 *
 * The argument to frr_with_privs() can be NULL to leave privileges as-is
 * (mostly useful for conditional privilege-raising, i.e.:)
 *   frr_with_privs(cond ? &privs : NULL) {}
 *
 * NB: The code block is always executed, regardless of whether privileges
 * could be raised or not, or whether NULL was given or not.  This is fully
 * intentional;  the user may have configured some RBAC or similar that we
 * are not aware of, but that allows our code to proceed without privileges.
 *
 * The point of this wrapper is to prevent accidental bugs where privileges
 * are elevated but then not dropped.  This can happen when, for example, a
 * "return", "goto" or "break" in the middle of the elevated-privilege code
 * skips past the privilege dropping call.
 *
 * The macro below uses variable cleanup to drop privileges as soon as the
 * code block is left in any way (and thus the _privs variable goes out of
 * scope.)  _once is just a trick to run the loop exactly once.
