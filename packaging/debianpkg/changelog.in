  * New upstream release. 
    - [bgpd] The semantics of default-originate route-map have changed.
      The route-map is now used to advertise the default route conditionally.
      The old behaviour which allowed to set attributes on the originated
      default route is no longer supported.

      added in 0.99.21 and may not be desirable.  If you need a version
      without this behaviour, please use 0.99.20.1.  There will be a
      runtime configuration switch for this in future versions.
    - [isisd] is in "beta" state.
    - [ospf6d] is in "alpha/experimental" state
    - More changes are documented in the upstream changelog!

    Security, where a bgpd could be crashed if a peer sent a malformed OPEN
    message or a malformed COMMUNITY attribute. Only configured peers can do
    this, hence we consider these issues to be very low impact." CVE-2007-4826

quagga (0.99.6-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * SECURITY:
    The bgpd daemon was vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service. Configured peers
    could cause a Quagga bgpd to, typically, assert() and abort. The DoS 
    could be triggered by peers by sending an UPDATE message with a crafted,
    malformed Multi-Protocol reachable/unreachable NLRI attribute.
    This is CVE-2007-1995 and Quagga Bug#354. Closes: #418323

quagga (0.99.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added default PAM file and some explanations regarding PAM authentication
    of vtysh which could prevent the start at boot-time when used wrong. 
    Now PAM permits anybody to access the vtysh tool (a malicious user could
    build his own vtysh without PAM anyway) and the access is controled by
    the read/write permissions of the vtysh socket which are only granted to
    users belonging to the quaggavty group (thanks to Wakko Warner).
    Closes: #389496
  * Added "case" to prerm script so that the Debconf question is not called a
    second time in e.g. "new-prerm abort-upgrade" after being NACKed in the

quagga (0.99.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

    for /proc/1 as not all systems (e.g. 2.6 arm kernels) have

    Buytenhek). Closes: #335695

quagga (0.99.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * A Debconf question now asks the admin before upgrading if the daemon
    should really be stopped as this could lead to the loss of network
    connectivity or BGP flaps (thanks to Michael Horn and Achilleas Kotsis).
    Also added a hint about setting Quagga "on hold" to README.Debian.
    Closes: #315467

quagga (0.99.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Among others:
    - BGP graceful restart and "match ip route-source" added
    - support for interface renaming
    - improved threading for better responsivness under load
  * Switched to dpatch to make diffs cleaner.
  * Made autoreconf unnecessary.
  * Replaced quagga.dvi and quagga.ps by quagga.pdf in quagga-doc.
    (the PostScript would have needed Makefile corrections and PDF
    is more preferable anyway)
  * Added isisd to the list of daemons in /etc/init.d/quagga (thanks
    to Ernesto Elbe).
  * Added hint for "netlink-listen: overrun" messages (thanks to
    Hasso Tepper).

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Fri, 13 May 2005 01:18:24 +0200

quagga (0.98.3-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed SNMP support as linking against NetSNMP introduced a dependency
    to OpenSSL which is not compatible to the GPL which governs this
    application (thanks to Faidon Liambotis). See README.Debian for more
    information. Closes: #306840
  * Changed listening address of ospf6d and ripngd from 127.0.0.1 to "::1".

quagga (0.98.3-6) testing-proposed-updates; urgency=high

  * Removed "Recommends kernel-image-2.4" as aptitude then
    installes a kernel-image for an arbitrary architecture as long
    as it fullfill that recommendation which can obviously fatal
    at the next reboot :) Also it is a violation of the policy
    which mandates a reference to real packages (thanks to Holger Levsen).
    Closes: #307281

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Tue,  3 May 2005 22:53:39 +0200

quagga (0.98.3-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * The patch which tried to remove the OpenSSL dependency, which is
    not only unneccessary but also a violation of the licence and thus RC,
    stopped working a while ago, since autoreconf is no longer run before
    building the binaries. So now ./configure is patched directly (thanks
    to Faidon Liambotis for reporting). Closes: #306840
  * Raised Debhelper compatibility level from 3 to 4. Nothing changed.
  * Added build-dep to texinfo (>= 4.7) to ease work for www.backports.org.

quagga (0.98.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

    put into NEWS.Debian (thanks to Steve Langasek). Closes: #306384

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Apr 2005 00:10:24 +0200

quagga (0.98.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Adding the debconf module due to a lintian suggestion is a very
    bad idea if no db_stop is called as the script hangs then (thanks

    Mmost notably fixes last regression in bgpd (reannounce of prefixes

    handling while using IPv6, MTU changes handling in ospfd and several
    crashes in ospfd, bgpd and ospf6d.

quagga (0.98.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Quoting the upstream announcement:
    The 0.98.1 release unfortunately was a brown paper bag release with
    respect to ospfd. [...] 0.98.2 has been released, with one crucial change 
    to fix the unfortunate mistake in 0.98.1, which caused problems if 
    ospfd became DR.  
  * Note: the upstream tarball had a strange problem, apparently redhat.spec
    was twice in it? At least debuild gave a strange error message so I
    unpacked it by hand. No changes were made to the .orig.tar.gz!

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Feb 2005 01:31:36 +0100

    For some unknown reason the upstream Makefile modified a .h file at

    http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-307.html

    kernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine. This could
