This directory contains the debian directories for backports to other debian
platforms.  These are built via the `3.0 (custom)' source format, which
allows one to build a source package directly out of tarballs (e.g. an
orig.tar.gz tarball and a debian.tar.gz file), at which point the format can
be changed to a real format (e.g. `3.0 (quilt)').

Source packages are assembled via targets of the same name as the system to
which the backport is done (e.g. `precise'), included in debian/rules.

To create a new debian backport:

* Add its name to `KNOWN_BACKPORTS', defined in debian/rules.
* Create a directory of the same name in debian/backports.
* Add the files `exclude', `versionext', and `debian/source/format' under
  this directory:
  * `exclude' contains whitespace-separated paths (relative to the root of
    the source dir) that should be excluded from the source package (e.g.
    debian/patches).
  * `versionext' contains the suffix added to the version number for this
    backport's build.  Distributions often have guidelines for what this
    should be. If left empty, no new debian/changelog entry is created.
  * `debian/source/format' should contain the source format of the resulting
    source package.  As of of the writing of this document the only supported
    format is `3.0 (quilt)'.
* Add appropriate files under the `debian/' subdirectory.  These will be
  included in the source package, overriding any top-level `debian/' files
  with equivalent paths.
