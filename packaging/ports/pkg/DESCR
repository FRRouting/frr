=============
WHAT IS ZEBRA
=============
  Zebra is a free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocol.
  It takes multi-server and multi-thread approach to resolve the current
complexity of the Internet.

  Currently zebra is still under development, so If you want to use zebra,
I strongly recommend you to get the latest version of zebra.
  Zebra snapshot is released on every monday.

===================
SUPPORTED Protocols
===================
  Zebra supports both IPv4 and IPv6 :-)
  For supporting IPv4 Routing protocols is here
	RIP (both version1 and version2)
		RIPv2 supports both Multicast and Broadcast
	BGP (only support BGP4)

  For supporting IPv6 Routing protocols is here
	RIPng
	BGP4+

===================
Supported plat-home
===================
  Now zebra is testing on 
  o FreeBSD 2.2.8
      -- without IPv6 ;-)
      -- with KAME
      -- with INRIA IPv6 protocol stack.

  o GNU/Linux 2.2.2
  o GNU/Linux 2.0.36

===========
ZEBRA Ports
===========
  Each daemon has each own terminal interface.  Also zebra has communication
port which provides several services to other daemons.  Below is zebra ports
