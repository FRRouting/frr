This file describes the procedure for reporting FRRouting bugs. You are not
obliged to follow this format, but it would be great help for FRRouting developers
if you report a bug as described below.

Bugs submitted with woefully incomplete information may be summarily
closed.  Submitters of bugs against old versions may be asked to
retest against the latest release.  Submitters may be asked for
additional information.  Bugs may be closed after 30 days of
non-response to requests to reconfirm or supply additional
information.

Report bugs on Github Issue Tracker at 
    https://github.com/frrouting/frr/issues

Please supply the following information:
1. Your FRRouting version or if it is from git then the  commit reference.
   Please try to report bugs against git master or the latest release.
2. FRR daemons you run e.g. bgpd or ripd and full name of your OS. Any
   specific options you compiled FRR with. 
3. Problem description. Copy and paste relative commands and their output to
   describe your network setup e.g. "zebra>show ip route".
   Please, also give your simple network layout and output of relative OS
   commands (e.g., ifconfig (BSD) or ip (Linux)).
4. All FRR configuration files you use. If you don't want to publish your
   network numbers change 2 middle bytes in IPv4 address to be XXX (e.g.
   192.XXX.XXX.32/24). Similar could be done with IPv6.
5. If any FRR daemon core dumped, please, supply stack trace using the
   following commands: host> gdb exec_file core_file , (gdb) bt .
6. Run all FRR daemons with full debugging on (see documentation on
   debugging) and send _only_ part of logs which are relative to your problem.
7. If the problem is difficult to reproduce please send a shell script to
   reproduce it.
8. Patches, workarounds, fixes are always welcome.

Thank You.
