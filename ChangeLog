2004-01-10 Vincent Jardin <jardin@6wind.com>

	* configure.ac: add the redhat/Makefile as a AC_OUTPUT() argument.
	It fixes build on FreeBSD 5.1 and FreeBSD 4.7

2004-01-08 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: as per gdt, specify the redhat dir as a DIST_SUBDIR,
	  remove the redhat/... dist targets - instead these now go in..
	  redhat/Makefile.am: (new) proper place to describe redhat/ dist 
	  files, as well as allow quagga.spec to be regenerated properly.
	  redhat/quagga.sysconfig: specify conf file location.
	  redhat/quagga.spec.in: Add 2 patches to RPM build.
	  
2003-12-30 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* redhat/isisd.init: new file, init script for isisd.
	  redhat/quagga.sysconfig: new file, sysconfig file for quagga
	  initscripts. 
	  redhat/quagga.spec.in: various cleanups, including sysconfig patch
	  from RH, fixed UID/GID as per RH EL, shell changed to 
	  /sbin/nologin, daemon vty's listen to 127.1 only per default and 
	  isisd packaged.
	  redhat/*.init: sysconfig support and runlevels specified.
	  
2003-12-30 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: put the redhat/ stuff into EXTRA_DIST rather than
	  copying via dist-hook. Remove ~ files backup cruft from dists.
	  isisd/Makefile.am: sysconf example should go via
	  dist_examples_DATA. The include-netbsd/ headers werent mentioned
	  as sources and werent being copied into dists.
	  
2003-12-23 Vincent Jardin <jardin@6wind.com>

	* isisd: Import isisd from Sampo Saaristo's source code.

2003-12-22 Christian Hammers <ch@lathspell.de>

	* configure.ac (and everywhere a regular file is opened for
	  writing): use file permissions from configure rather than
	  compiled-in umask.

2003-12-22 Hasso Tepper <hasso@estpak.ee>

	* lib/linklist.c: Revert microfix I commited while reverting 
	  [quagga-dev 227]. Caused by misreading code.

2003-12-21 Hasso Tepper <hasso@estpak.ee>

	* lib/linklist.c: Revert patch [quagga-dev 227]. listnode_add_sort()
	  function should not drop nodes in any case. But fix behavior where
	  nodes were added to the end of list when cmp returned 0.
	* lib/if.c: Check for duplicates before calling listnode_add_sort().

2003-12-08  Greg Troxel  <gdt@fnord.ir.bbn.com>

	* {lib,ospfd,ospfapi}/Makefile.am: Use pkginclude_HEADERS rather
	than include_HEADERS to place includes in
	${prefix}/include/quaggainstead of polluting ${prefix}/include.

2003-12-04  Greg Troxel  <gdt@poblano.ir.bbn.com>

	* configure.ac: When setting exampledir to sysconfdir as a
	default, don't quote ${sysconfdir}.  (Bug reported by Vincent
	Jardin.)

2003-12-03  Greg Troxel  <gdt@poblano.ir.bbn.com>

	* configure.ac: Compile in Router Advertisement support by
	default.  Note that this does not default to sending RAs; it just
	makes 'ipv6 nd send-ra' and 'ipv6 nd prefix-advertisement'
	available.  While others may prefer other tools, no argument has
	been made that router advertisement support is such bloat that it
	should be compiled out by default (it 9556 bytes on NetBSD/i386 vs
	8 bytes with the support compiled out). This reversion of a
	previous change was done in consultation with Paul.

2003-12-03  Greg Troxel  <gdt@poblano.ir.bbn.com>

	* configure.ac: Move tests for v6 header files to after the check
	for v6 code version, and conditionalize on the right variable.
	(Fixes problem where v6 header files are not included when v6 is
	enabled implicitly.)

2003-12-03  Greg Troxel  <gdt@poblano.ir.bbn.com>

	* configure.ac: Add --enable-exampledir to specify where example
	config files should go, defaulting to sysconfdir.

	* */Makefile.am: use exampledir instead of sysconfdif for examples

2003-11-02 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * bgpd/bgp_routemap.c: Fix up 'set ip next-hop A.B.C.D|peer-address'
          route map command so that vtysh can use it. Modified version of   
          Hasso Tepper's patch. Fixes bug #52.
        * configure.ac: FreeBSD has net-snmp in /usr/local.
        * redhat/quagga.spec.in: Install libzebra headers with -devel
          package.

2003-11-02 Krzysztof Oledzki <oleq@ans.pl>

        * zebra/zebra_rib.c: Revert patch (dating from zebra.org) which  
          caused zebra to read all routes in all tables, rather than just
          the main table. See [quagga-dev 280].

2003-10-30 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * configure.ac: netinet/in_systm.h is yet another well-known
          header file we really should be checking for

2003-10-27 kamatchi soundaram <kamatchi@tdd.sj.nec.com>

        * ospfd/ospfd.c: Do not increment act_int for an area, as it is done
          by ospf_ism.c::ism_change_state() - results in incorrect figure
          for active interfaces in an area.

2003-10-27 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * lib/if.{ch}: remove ifc_pointtopoint() - left over from the
          reverted RFC3021 patch.

2003-10-27 Simon <lists@routemeister.net>

        * ospfd/ospfd.c: if_is_pointopoint() takes (struct interface *), was
          being called with struct connected. Change to co->ifp.

2003-10-27 Gilad Arnold <gilad.arnold@terayon.com>

        * zebra/zebra_rib.c: (nexthop_active_update) Check for multipath
          limit when setting changed flag to avoid spurious changes.
          (static_install_ipv{4,6}) dont uninstall by default, might not be
          required - avoid spurious uninstalls.
          (static_uninstall_ipv{4,6}) only uninstall the route if its
          actually FIB route.

2003-10-24 sowmini.varadhan@sun.com

        * ospfd/ospf_network.c: (ospf_sock_init) Exit if socket can not be
          created.

2003-10-24 Jose Luis Rubio Guivernau <jrubio@dit.upm.es>

        * Better 'show bgp' support for views (eg ipv6), see [quagga-dev 238]
        * bgpd/bgp_route.c: (bgp_show) Take a struct bgp argument instead of
          view string.
          (bgp_show_neighbor_route) Take a struct peer argument instead of
          ip string.
          (peer_adj_routes) ditto
          (show_adj_routes) ditto
          (peer_lookup_in_view) new function to return appropriate struct
          peer for a given view string.
          (misc) Fixup all calls to above to reflect new calling arguments,
          and use peer_lookup_in_view as needed. Additional commands
          installed to use expanded functionality above, existing commands
          modified to suit as well.
        * bgpd/bgp_vty.c: 2 new aliases.

2003-10-24 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * configure.ac: Check for fcntl()
        * {bgpd,ospf,ospf6d,ripd,ripngd}/Makefile.am: Install conf file via
          regular automake means, not magic install incantations, see
          bug #38.
        * lib/Makefile.am: install the headers, needed to link libzebra.a
          (and hence libospf.a, OSPF-API, etc.)

2003-10-24 waldi@debian.org

        * vtysh/Makefile.am: vtysh_cmd.c rebuild was broken because it
          depended against source files without specification, i.e. it
          used ../zebra instead of $(top_srcdir)/zebra.

2003-10-23 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * configure.ac: IRIX configure.ac support. Sort of works.
          sysctl() crashes though (ipforward), there's some kind of odd
          padding in the PF_ROUTE socket messages and setsockopt() on
          SOCK_RAW does not work (so ospfd doesnt work).

2003-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * vtysh/Makefile.am: do not include vtysh_cmd.c in dists, its
          configure dependent. (still need to find a way to make building of
          it dependent on configure options or include all commands.)

2003-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * lib/zebra.h: include limits.h if its there, its a portable header
          and useful and not just solaris specific. net/route.h is also
          useful.

2003-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * lib/regex.c: bzero -> memset
        * zebra/ioctl.c: ditto. bzero is not portable.

2003-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * zebra/kernel_socket.c: HAVE_IPV6 conditional for WRAPUP when
          HAVE_SA_LEN is not defined. bcopy -> memcpy, bcopy is not
          portable.

2003-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * configure.ac: Split up header checks into non-net, net and ipv6
          related. Checking of IPv6 is conditional. Add some more output
          text for the end of the configure run.

2003-10-18 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>

        * bgpd/bgp_attr.c: (bgp_dump_routes_attr) Dont dump IPv4 nexthop
          for IP. Dump MP_NLRI attr with IPv6 next-hop for AF_INET6 address
          family prefixes. Accept prefix as argument.
        * bgpd/bgp_attr.c: modify bgp_dump_routes_attr declaration.
        * bgpd/bgp_dump.c: (bgp_dump_routes_entry) Modify calls to
          bgp_dump_routes_attr.
          (bgp_dump_common) Go by the family of the peering socket, not
          configured address family when dumping peering information.
          Add HAVE_IPV6 conditionals, eg missing from previous bgp interval
          patch.

2003-10-18 Lorenzo Colitti <lorenzo@ripe.net>

        * bgpd/bgp_dump.{c,h}: (bgp_dump_interval_add) Dump at discrete
          fixed intervals rather than fixed intervals from startup time.
          (bgp_dump_interval_func) Dont return immediately if file cant be
          openeded, but reschedule interval dumps, even - admin might
          fix problem in meantime. Close the dump file in between intervals.
          (bgp_dump_init) account for MSG header when initialising stream
          size.

2003-10-15 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * ospfd/ospf_interface: (ospf_if_lookup_table) new function to
          lookup oi for a given prefix in a given interfaces table of oi's.
          (ospf_if_new) use ospf_if_lookup_table to deal with zebra
          reporting new interface multiple times.
          NB: This patch is a complete plaster-band of a hack. First, why is
          zebra reporting interface events multiple times? Second, why does
          ospfd maintain so many damn lists and tables relating to oi's -
          these should be reconciled into one or two tables.

2003-10-15 sowmini.varadhan@sun.com

        * ripd/ripd.c: (rip_send_packet) use rip->sock for mcast sends,
          instead of creating one socket per send. send source addr to
          rip_update_interface.
          (rip_update_process) should send an update on every connected
          network for each interface.
          (rip_request_send) should send a request on every connected
          network for each interface.
        * ripd/ripd.h: update prototype for rip_interface_multicast_set
        * ripd/rip_interface.c: (rip_interface_multicast_set) reorganized
          so that it can be called repeatedly for aliased interfaces (on
          multiple networks).

2003-10-15 Jay Fenlason <fenlason@redhat.com>

        * lib/vty.c: (vty_telnet_option) Remote DoS exists if a telnet
          end-sub-negotation is sent when no sub-negotation data has been
          sent. Return immediately if no sub-negotation is in progress.
          (vty_read) do not attempt to process options if no sub-negotation
          is in progress.

2003-10-15 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * lib/vty.c: (vty_save_cwd) dont crash if getcwd fails. try fallback
          to SYSCONFDIR. Allocate cwd from the stack rather than relying on
          (non-portable) getcwd() allocation (which we didnt seem to be
          freeing).

2003-10-13 Jay Fenlason <fenlason@redhat.com>

        * lib/zebra.h: define UINT32_MAX for those systems which do not
          provide it.
        * bgp_attr.h: define BGP_MED_MAX.
        * bgp_route.c: update defines/constants to BGP_MED_MAX.
        * bgp_routemap.c: ditto. clean up route_match_metric_compile
          slightly to avoid unneccesary XMALLOC.

2003-10-13 sowmini.varadhan@sun.com

        * ospf_lsa.h: Add OSPF_LSA_PREMATURE_AGE flag.
        * ospf_lsa.c: added better debug comments. check sequence number in
          ospf_lsa_install. ospf_maxage_lsa_remover() checks for
          OSPF_LSA_PREMATURE_AGE and re-originates the lsa after ls_acks are
          received.
        * ospf_flood.c: improve debug statement- print ls_seqnum.

2003-10-13 Douglas Fraser <doug+quagga@idmf.net>

        * zebra/connected.c: PtP revert fixup. Zebra was not creating
        connected route for PtP peer.

2003-10-07 Tarhon-Onu Victor <mituc@iasi.rdsnet.ro>

        * zebra/ipforward_proc.c: (ipforward) Close the fd for
        /proc/net/snmp. See [quagga-dev 284]

2003-09-29 Gilad Arnold <gilad.arnold@terayon.com>

        * zebra/zebra_rib.c: Fix possible dangling reference to rib
        route_nodes - unlock it the appropriate number of times. (twice,
        because of the implicit lock). see [quagga-dev 251].

2003-09-29 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * zebra/connected.c: revert the 'generic PtP' patch as it causes
        far too many problems. People who use FreeSWAN should investigate
        native linux ipsec.
        * zebra/rt_netlink.c: ditto
        * lib/if.c: ditto
        * ripd/ripd.h: ditto
        * ripd/ripd.c: ditto
        * ripd/rip_interface.c: ditto
        * ospfd/ospfd.c: ditto
        * ospfd/ospf_snmp.c: ditto
        * bgpd/bgp_nexthop.c: ditto
        * ospfd/ospf_packet.c: Add debug output for some of the previously
          completely silent drops of 'bad' packets.
        * configure.ac: bump version

2003-08-27 Jay Fenlason <fenlason@redhat.com>

        * lib/Makefile.am: Do not use a lib (libcap) as a dependency
        * zebra/Makefile.am: Link in libcap
        * bgpd/bgp_routemap.c: attr->med is type u_in32_t, should be
          compared with UINT32_MAX
        * ospfd/ospfd.c: remove redundant assert
        * zebra/rtadv.c: add missing include for zebra/rib.h

2003-09-24 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

        * lib/version.h: moved to version.h.in
        * lib/version.h.in: New file, from version.h. Change hardcoded
          package name and version to use the autoconf defined substition
          variables.
        * configure.ac: Fix up AC/AM_INIT* to new style. Remove the sed'ing
          through lib/version.h for VERSION. Add lib/version.h to the
          AC_OUTPUT list. Update the text output of quagga version at end
          of configure run to use PACKAGE_VERSION.
        * doc/.cvsignore: ignore quagga.pdf
        * doc/.cvsignore: ignore version.h, its now autogenerated.

2003-09-24 sowmini.varadhan@sun.com

        * lib/if.c: (if_cmp_func) fix infinite loop if
          ifp1->name == ifp2->name
        * lib/linklist.c: (if_cmp_func) Fix handling of case where
          list->cmp returns 0.
        * rip_interface.c: (rip_interface_address_add) call
          rip_enable_apply(), or the interface is never considered up.
          see [quagga-dev 225].
        * zebra/kernel_socket.c: Fix up WRAPUP macro to deal with multiple
          address families in the absence of sa_len element in struct
          sockaddr.
          (ifm_read): Handle solaris 9 if_msghdr_t.
          Deal with interfaces which are incomplete, lookup on name rather
          than the placeholder interface index of -1.

2003-09-24 Thomas Giger TGC <thomas.giger@tgc.de>

        * ospf_packet.c (ospf_associate_packet_vl): pass NULL struct
          interface to ospf_if_lookup_by_local_addr() rather than the
          receiving interface ifp, packets for VL's could come in any
          interface. See quagga-dev 250.

1999-03-02  Peter Galbavy  <Peter.Galbavy@knowledge.com>

	* reworked include file structure, and configure so that all
 	source files get all system-dependent include files by including
 	<zebra.h> which is really lib/zebra.h. This means that the
 	different programs include files are now available as #include
 	"zebra/zebra.h" - note the use of quotes, not <> as delimiters.

	In practical terms, if I haven't really screwed up, the main file
 	that maintainers for other OSes have to change is lib/zebra.h for
 	all the conditional includes etc.

	* added --disable-pthread for those systems that seem to have
 	POSIX threads, but do not work. OpenBSD 2.4+ is like that just
 	now. Changed all occurance of #ifdef PTHREAD to use HAVE_PTHREAD

1999-02-22  Peter Galbavy  <Peter.Galbavy@knowledge.com>

	* added a "log" element to the BGPd peer structure, enabling us to
 	start thinging about a log stream per peer. This is currently
 	ignored by the wrapper code, but developers should try to use the
 	"appropriate" ZLOG stream. Documentation will follow, when the
 	real routines start to exist.

	The current plan is to use a copy of the BSD syslog() routines and
 	replace the syslog library function with our own. I will need
 	feedback from users of other platforms as this work is done to see
 	if all is well elsewhere.
	
	* preliminary work on zlog() library. directly replaces syslog()
 	currently with zlog(ZLOG *, ...) where the new first argument
	is a pointer to a ZLOG structure (defined in lib/log.h) and will
	encapsulate all the information necessary to maintain multiple
	logging streams.

1999-02-19  Peter Galbavy  <Peter.Galbavy@knowledge.com>

	* added vsnprintf() macro to lib/str.h if required and removed
