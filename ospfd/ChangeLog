	* ospf_network.c: (ospf_adjust_sndbuflen) Don't complain
	  about getting more buffer space, than requested.
	* ospfd.[ch]: (ospf_new) Abandon OSPF_SNDBUFLEN_DEFAULT
	  and consider OS's initial buffer size instead.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_up) Fix missing argument.

2007-08-21 Denis Ovsienko

	* ospfd.h: Extend struct ospf with maxsndbuflen field and
	  define its default value.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_new) init maxsndbuflen
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_up) Call ospf_adjust_sndbuflen()
	  for each regular interface being brought up.
	* ospf_network.[ch]: (ospf_adjust_sndbuflen) New function
	  makes sure ospf socket sending buffer is large enough
	  to cover the biggest interface MTU we have seen ever.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write) Use maxsndbuflen to decide on
	  the biggest amount of data we are going to send at once.

2007-08-07 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: (ospf_spf_next) Finish off the explanatory
	  comment made in previous commit

2007-08-07 Atis Elsts <atis@mikrotik.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: (ospf_spf_next) Sort heap in correct direction
	  after vertex cost is changed, thus fixing incorrect SPF
	  calculation on certain topologies.

2007-08-06 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_lsa.c: (router_lsa_flags) Bug #331, NSSA regression caused
	  caused ASBRs to not advertise E-bit into NSSA areas.

2007-05-09 Milan Kocian <milon@wq.cz>

	* ospf_vty.c: Fix commands: 'ip ospf authentication A.B.C.D',
	  'no ip ospf authentication A.B.C.D', 'no ip ospf
	  authentication-key A.B.C.D'. Simply fix argv's indexes and
          argc check in DEFUN functions.

2007-05-07 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: (ospf_vertex_new) Dont init vertices to infinity,
	  just let 0 be a special case.
	  (ospf_spf_add_parent) 0 distance candidate vertex is special,
	  cost still to be initialised - asserting that new distance
	  is <= existing only makes sense where w already has a cost.
	  (ospf_spf_next) Infinite cost links should not be followed,
	  bar those of the root.

2007-04-30 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_network_match_iface) Comment out
	  COMPATIBILITY_MODE.  Going forward, the ospf "network" command
	  will use a simple test: does the network command prefix
	  contain the connected (destination) prefix of the interface?

2007-04-21 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_set_multicast) Fix bug: was testing
	  interface passive status improperly in light of the recent
	  'passive-interface default' patch.  Now need to test
	  OSPF_IF_PASSIVE_STATUS(oi) instead of
	  OSPF_IF_PARAM(oi, passive_interface).

2007-03-23 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: (various) Add more debug statements.
	  (ospf_nexthop_calculation) Fix silly regression causing ospfd
	  to fail to calculate paths past networks not attached to root
	  vertex, introduced with bug #330 fixes.

2007-03-14 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_snmp.c: (ospf_snmp_neighbor_state) New function to
	  map internal quagga neighbor states to SNMP standard values.
	  (ospfNbrEntry) Call new ospf_snmp_neighbor_state function.

2007-03-14 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_zebra_add, ospf_zebra_delete) Fix bug
	  where inet_ntoa was used twice in the same debug message,
	  which doesn't work because there's a single shared buffer
	  for the returned string.  The fix is to use inet_ntop.

2007-02-27 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_terminate) Exit immediately if ospf is not
	  actually running (e.g. the config file was empty).  Fixes
	  bug where SIGTERM would not kill ospfd.

2007-02-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: Fix regression introduced with bug #330 fix: The
	  cost update added to ospf_spf_add_parent only handled PtP
	  case, differing from same functionality in higher-level
	  ospf_spf_next. Regression diagnosed by Anders Pedersen,
	  mailnews+router-quagga-dev@news.cohaesio.com.
	  (ospf_vertex_new) Initialise vertices to max-cost.
	  (ospf_spf_init) Root vertex always creates with 0 cost.
	  (ospf_spf_add_parent) Remove the buggy V->W cost calculating
	  code, instead take the new distance as a parameter.
	  (ospf_nexthop_calculation) Take distance as parameter, so it
	  can be passed down to add_parent.
	  (ospf_spf_next) Dont initialise candiate vertex distance,
	  vertex_new does so already. Pass distance down to
	  nexthop_calculation (see above).

2007-01-24 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: Bug #330: Nexthop calculation sometimes may fail,
	  and it needs to indicate this result to SPF.
	  (ospf_spf_add_parent) Flush of parent list needs to be done here,
	  for simplicity.
	  (ospf_nexthop_calculation) Caller needs to know whether
	  nexthop calculation succeeded. Every return statement must
	  correctly indicate such.
	  (ospf_spf_next) Queueing/prioritisation of vertices in SPF
	  must take into account whether nexthop_calculation succeeded,
	  or SPF may fail to find best paths.

2006-12-12 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_is_configured, ospf_if_lookup_by_prefix,
	  ospf_if_lookup_recv_if) Simplify logic using new CONNECTED_PREFIX
	  macro.
	* ospf_lsa.c: (lsa_link_ptop_set) Using the new CONNECTED_PREFIX
	  macro, both options collapse into the same code.
	* ospf_snmp.c: (ospf_snmp_if_update) Simplify logic using new
	  CONNECTED_ID macro.
	  (ospf_snmp_is_if_have_addr) Simplify logic using new CONNECTED_PREFIX
	  macro.
	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) Use new CONNECTED_PEER macro
	  instead of testing the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_network_match_iface) Use new CONNECTED_PEER macro
	  instead of testing with if_is_pointopoint.  And add commented-out
	  code to implement alternative (in my opinion) more elegant behavior
	  that has no special-case treatment for PtP addresses.
	  (ospf_network_run) Use new CONNECTED_ID macro to simplify logic.

2006-12-04 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_network_run) Remove an offending 'break' statement.
	  Previously, after creating a single ospf_interface on a given
	  network interface, the code would skip to the next interface
	  without considering other connected addresses on the interface.
	  After removing the 'break', we now consider all connected addresses.

2006-11-30 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_router_id_update_zebra,
	  ospf_interface_address_add, ospf_interface_address_delete)
	  If (IS_DEBUG_OSPF (zebra, ZEBRA_INTERFACE)) is enabled, then
	  add a debug message about what Zebra is telling us.
	  (ospf_zebra_add_discard) Add a debug message matching the one
	  already in ospf_zebra_delete_discard.

2006-11-28 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_vty.c: (ospf_passive_interface_default) Take additional
	  'newval' arg so we can update ospf->passive_interface_default inside
	  this function.  More importantly, we now call ospf_if_set_multicast
	  on all ospf_interfaces.
	  (ospf_passive_interface, no_ospf_passive_interface) Fix bug:
	  for 'default' case, argv[0] is undefined, so we must test for
	  (argc == 0) before using argv[0].  And since
	  ospf_passive_interface_default now calls ospf_if_set_multicast as
	  needed, we can just return after calling
	  ospf_passive_interface_default.

2006-10-24 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_redistribute_default_set) Fix bug where
	  a new value for ospf->default_originate was being ignored
	  if a previous 'default-information originate' command
	  had already been processed.

2006-10-22 Yar Tikhiy <yar@comp.chem.msu.su>

	* (general) Add support for passive-interface default (with
	  minor edits by Paul Jakma).
	* ospf_interface.h: Add OSPF_IF_PASSIVE_STATUS macro, looking
	  at configured value, or the global 'default' value, as
	  required.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_new_hook) Leave passive
	  unconfigured per default, allowing global 'default' to
	  take effect for unconfigured interfaces.
	* ospf_packet.c: (various) use OSPF_IF_PASSIVE_STATUS
	* ospf_vty.c: (ospf_passive_interface_default) new function,
	  unset passive from all interfaces if default is enabled, as
	  the per-iface settings become redundant.
	  (ospf_passive_interface_update) new func, update passive
	  setting taking global default into account.
	  ({no,}ospf_passive_interface_addr_cmd) Add support for
	  'default' variant of command.
	  (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) Update to take global
	  default into account when printing passive status.
	  (ospf_config_write) ditto.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_new) set global passive-interface default.
	* ospfd.h: (struct ospf) Add field for global
          passive-interface.
	  
2006-09-25 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_packet_dup, ospf_make_md5_digest) 
	  Fix zlog_warn messages to eliminate compiler warnings.
	  (ospf_hello) Improve warning messages to show why we
	  are complaining.

2006-08-28 Andy Gay <andy@andynet.net>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_make_db_desc) Assert added with More-bit
	  fixes does not hold up with addition of Ogier DB-Exchange
	  optimisation, which can empty the db-summary list in between
	  sent DD packets. Remove assert, update More-bit always when
	  in Exchange.

2006-08-27 J.J. Krabbendam <jkrabbendam@aimsys.nl>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_finish_final) default redistribute should be
	  unset too, fixes bug where reconfiguring ospfd completely
	  can no longer enable default redistribution.

2006-08-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) Bug #134. Be more robust to backward time changes,
	  use the newly added libzebra time functions.
	  In most cases: recent_time -> recent_relative_time()
	  gettimeofday -> quagga_gettime (QUAGGA_CLK_MONOTONIC, ..)
	  time -> quagga_time.
	  (ospf_make_md5_digest) time() call deliberately not changed.
	  (ospf_external_lsa_refresh) remove useless gettimeofday, LSA
	  tv_orig time was already set in ospf_lsa_new, called via
	  ospf_external_lsa_new.

2006-08-04 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_lsdb.c: (ospf_lsdb_delete_entry) new function, consolidate
	  exact same functionality replicated in other functions.
	  (ospf_lsdb_add) Strip out code by using ospf_lsdb_delete_entry.
	  (ospf_lsdb_delete) ditto.
	  (ospf_lsdb_delete_all) ditto.

2006-08-03 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_make_db_desc) Unset the DD More bit
	  after constructing the packet, if appropriate. 
	  (ospf_db_desc_proc) Speed up Exchange, slave should raise
	  ExchangeDone earlier, as RFC mandates, by forming its reply
	  before deciding whether both sides are done, avoids a
	  needless round of empty DD packet exchanges at the end of
	  Exchange, hence speeding up ExchangeDone.
	  Implement draft-ogier-ospf-dbex-opt DB-exchange optimisation.
	  (ospf_db_desc) use UNSET_FLAG macro.

2006-07-27 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_router_id_update) Fix and document the algorithm for
	  selecting the router ID: if there is not a statically configured ID,
	  then stick to the most recent value to avoid disruptive changes.
	  This should fix bug #288.

2006-07-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_lsa.{c,h}: (ospf_lsa_unlock) Change to take a double pointer
	  to the LSA to be 'unlocked', so that, if the LSA is freed, the
	  callers pointer to the LSA can be NULLed out, allowing any further
	  use of that pointer to provoke a crash sooner rather than later.
	* ospf_*.c: (general) Adjust callers of ospf_lsa_unlock to match
	  previous. Try annotate 'locking' somewhat to show which 'locks'
	  are protecting what LSA reference, if not obvious.
	* ospf_opaque.c: (ospf_opaque_lsa_install) Trivial: remove useless
	  goto, replace with return.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_make_ls_ack) Trivial: merge two list loops,
	  the dual-loop predated the delete-safe list-loop macro.

2006-07-25 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_neigbor.h: (struct ospf_neighbor) Add some additional
	  neighbour state statistics fields, timestamps for progressive
	  and regressive state changes, and pointer to event string
	  for the latter state change.
	* ospf_nsm.c: (nsm_notice_state_change) Update new state changs
	  history as required.
	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_neighbor_detail_sub) Print out above
	  new per-neighbour state change stats.

2006-07-10 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_nsm.c: (nsm_change_state) call nsm_clear_adj for all
	  adjacency losses, hence removing need for nsm_reset_nbr.
	  (nsm_reset_nbr) kill it, clear_adj in previous does fine.
	  (nsm_kill_nbr,nsm_start) remove nsm_reset_nbr call.
	  (ospf_nsm_event) Allow NSM function to be NULL, this along with
	  removal of nsm_reset_nbr, allows a bunch of now useless functiosn
	  to be removed.
	  Remove some useless variables.
	  (nsm_ignore) now useless, remove.
	  (nsm_bad_ls_req) ditto
	  (nsm_seq_number_mismatch)   "
	  (nsm_oneway_received)       "
	  (nsm_inactivity_timer)      "
	  (nsm_ll_down)               "
	  (NSM) replace removed action functions with NULL.
	  (nsm_notice_state_changes) Move state change logging code to new
	  func to declutter nsm_change_state and ospf_nsm_event.
	  Log event with AdjChange, it's useful to know.
	  (nsm_change_state) move adjchange and snmp logging to previous.
	  (ospf_nsm_event) call nsm_notice_state_changes from here.
	  Move the debug message to entry of function, so it gets out
	  even if something goes wrong.
	  Record state change timestamp and event in nbr struct.
	* ospf_neighbor.h: (struct ospf_neighbor) Add fields to record
	  timestamp of last NSM change and event.
	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_neighbor_detail_sub) Print 
	  last state change timestamp and event, if available.

2006-07-10 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_hello) Improve NetworkMask mismatch warning
	  message to include interface name and conflicting prefix lengths.

2006-07-07 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_nsm.h: Add a NSM_Deleted neighbour state, to act as dummy
	  state indicating the neighbour is to be deleted.
	* ospf_nsm.c: (general) Use the NSM_Deleted state to delete
	  neighbours, thus allowing code to be slightly more obvious
	  in its flow.
	  (nsm_timer_set) Add NSM_Deleted. Add another timer the code
	  missed.
	  (nsm_kill_nbr) No need for special case call to nsm_change_state
	  anymore.
	  Make the assert and error-handling for same case more readable
	  (Andrew Schorr)
	  Remove the call to ospf_nbr_delete, nsm_change_state can do
	  this generally now via NSM_Deleted.
	  (struct ... NSM) Add the dummy NSM_Deleted state, the 3 events
	  that can lead to nsm_kill_nbr all now transition the NBR to
	  NSM_Deleted and the general change_state function can be left
	  to do the work.
	  (ospf_nsm_event) Special casing of events and early-return can
	  be removed now.
	  On transition into Deleted, delete the nbr.
	* ospf_dump.c: (ospf_nsm_state_msg) Add Deleted.

2006-07-06 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_nsm.c: (ospf_nsm_event) LLDown event also results in nbr
	  being deleted, requires early-return too. Likely explains
	  some crash reports after interface events.

2006-07-04 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_nsm.c: (general) Various small cleanups from Andrew's
	  review of last set of patches.
	  (nsm_timer_set) Loading, Full and default can share
	  same code too.
	  (nsm_should_adj) Can just be one big OR.

2006-07-02 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_nsm.c: (nsm_should_adj) New function, just consolidate the
	  10.4 adjacency check from nsm_twoway_received/nsm_adj_ok.
	  (nsm_twoway_received/nsm_adj_ok) Use former.
	  (nsm_clear_adj) clear adjacency related state for a
	  neighbour, needed for some state changes from > ExStart down
	  to ExStart or less, which need not go through nsm_reset_nbr.
	  (nsm_reset_nbr) move code to former. Should be static.
	  (ospf_nsm_event) Don't allow action functions to change
	  next_state if the NSM tables do not indicate next_state is
	  conditional, log warning if one tries - existing code
	  appears fine though.
	  Remove long dead code.
	  Use nsm_clear_adj for state changes that take down
	  adjacencies to TwoWay/ExStart.
	  (nsm_timer_set) ls_req timer should be OFF in early states.
	  Compact several identical sections.
	  Set inactivity timer to OFF for Down, for documentary
	  purposes.
	  (nsm_kill_nbr) Oops, action function shouldn't try return
	  1 for error.
	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_translated_nssa_refresh) CID #13.

2006-06-30 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_neighbor_id) Should show all instances
	  of that neighbor (since it may appear on multiple interfaces)
	  instead of bailing out after showing the first match.

2006-06-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_nsm.c: (nsm_twoway_received) When deciding whether to
	  change from state Init to ExStart, the test for whether the
	  neighboring router is DR or BDR should be against the
	  local router's notion of DR/BDR, not the neighbor's view.

2006-06-28 Erik Muller <erikm@internap.com>

	* ospfd.h: Define 2 new struct ospf config flags:
	  OSPF_LOG_ADJACENCY_CHANGES and OSPF_LOG_ADJACENCY_DETAIL
	* ospf_nsm.c (nsm_change_state): Log adjacency changes if
	  requested.
	* ospf_vty.c (ospf_log_adjacency_changes): New command function
	  to implement ospf subcommand "log-adjacency-changes [detail]".
	  (no_ospf_log_adjacency_changes) Turn off log-adjacency-changes.
	  (show_ip_ospf) Show whether adjacency changes are logged.
	  (ospf_config_write) Add "log-adjacency-changes [detail]" to config.
	  (ospf_vty_init) Add ospf_log_adjacency_changes and
	  no_ospf_log_adjacency_changes.

2006-06-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_abr.c: (general) NSSA translate-candidate ABRs need to
	  be ASBRs, or other routers may rightfully refuse to install
	  translated type-5s LSAs. reported by dendroot@gmail.com.
	  (ospf_abr_nssa_check_status) Detect change in translator
	  state when ABR, and inc/dec redistribute count as when we
	  leave/enter the disabled state - so that translate-enabled
	  ABR properly sets ASBR bit on non-NSSA areas.
	  Run the resulting function through indent to clean it up.
	* ospf_lsa.c: (router_lsa_flags) For purposes of ASBR bit,
	  NSSA area is same as stub area.
	  
2006-06-24 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_snmp.c: (ospfTrapNbrStateChange, ospfTrapIfStateChange) Improve
	  info log message to indicate why the trap is being sent.

2006-06-24 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_dump.c: (config_write_debug) Fix typo to show debug ospf nsm
	  status properly (not ism status).

2006-06-17 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_vty.c: ({no_,}ospf_passive_interface) Replace if_lookup_by_name
	  with a call to if_get_by_name -- if the interface does not exist
	  already, it should be created.  And remove the obsolete warning
	  message.

2006-06-15 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_interface.h: (struct ospf_if_info) Add reference counts
	  for multicast group memberships. Add various macros to help
	  manipulate/check membership state.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_set_multicast) Maintain the
	  ospf_if_info reference counts, and only actually drop
	  memberships if it hits 0, to avoid losing membership when
	  OSPF is disabled on an interface with multiple active OSPF
	  interfaces.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_{hello,read}) Use the new macros to
	  check/set
	  multicast membership.

2006-05-12 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_lsa_action) Get rid of the ospf_lookup

	  (ospf_translated_nssa_refresh) Add non-assert sanity check,
	  in case DEBUG isn't defined.

 	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_exists) Fix missing NULL return
	  check on ospf_lookup, CID #27.
	* ospf_asbr.c: (ospf_redistribute_withdraw) remove ospf_lookup

	  caller has, fixing CID #28.
	* ospf_asbr.h: (ospf_redistribute_withdraw) update declaration
	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_redistribute_unset) update call to
	  ospf_redistribute_withdraw to match.
	* ospf_ia.c: (ospf_update_router_route) ospf->backbone could be
	  NULL when passed to ospf_find_asbr_route_through_area,
	  check for NULL first, CID #14.
	* ospf_ism.c: (ism_change_state) NULL check on oi->area is
	  useless, it's always valid. Only possibility where it
 	  couldn't be is if there is a race between abr_task and
	  cleaning up oi's, in which case a NULL check here isn't going
	  to do anything. Fixes CID #15.

2006-05-11 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_vty.c: (general) Audit ospf_lookup calls in commands,
	  ensure check for NULL result, make vty messages consistent. 
	  (show_ip_ospf_interface) Missing NULL check on ospf_lookup
	  result, fixes Coverity CID #70.
	  (no_ospf_area_filter_list) Check NULL result from
	  ospf_area_lookup_by_area_id, fixes Coverity CID #69
	* ospf_route.c: (ospf_route_delete_same_ext) Fix deref before
	  NULL check by moving into check-protected block, fix CID #49.
	* ospf_abr.c: (ospf_area_range_cost_set) Shouldn't create a new
	  range, should just lookup to see if one exists, the new range
	  is just leaked. Fixes CID #46.
	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_default_originate_timer) Let the thread
	  take (struct ospf *) as thread argument, rather than (struct
	  ospf *)->default_originate, thus avoiding having to call
	  ospf_lookup.
	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_redistribute_default_set) change setup
	  of ospf_default_originate_timer thread to match.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_router_id_update) ditto.

	* (general) More Virtual-link fixes, again with much help in
	  testing / debug from Juergen Kammer. Primarily in SPF.
	* ospf_spf.h: Add guard. ospf_interface.h will include this
	  header.
	* ospf_interface.h: Modify ospf_vl_lookup definition to take
	  struct ospf as argument, so as to allow for NULL area
	  argument.
	  (struct ospf_vl_data) Remove out_oi, instead add a struct
	  vertex_nexthop, to use as initial nexthop for backbone paths
	  through a vlink.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_vl_lookup) Modified to allow
	  NULL area to be passed to indicate "any" (first) area.
	  Add extra debug.
	  (ospf_vl_set_params) vl_oi -> nexthop. Add extra debug.
	  (ospf_vl_up_check) Fix debug, inet_ntoa returns a static
	  buffer..
	* ospf_route.c: (ospf_intra_add_router) Vlinks dont go through
	  backbone, don't bother checking.
	* ospf_spf.c: (static struct list vertex_list) Record vertices
	  that will need to be freed.
	  (cmp) Order network before router vertices, as required,
	  wasn't implemented.
	  (vertex_nexthop_free) Mild additional robustness check.
	  (vertex_parent_free) Take void argument, as this function
	  is passed as list deconstructor for vertex parent list.
	  (ospf_vertex_new) More debug. Set deconstructor for parent
	  list. Track allocated vertices on the vertex_list.
	  (ospf_vertex_free) Get rid of the tricky recursive cleanup of
	  vertices. Now frees only the given vertex. 
	  (ospf_vertex_add_parent) Fix assert.
	  (ospf_nexthop_calculation) Fix calculation of nexthop for
	  VLink vertices, lookup the vl_data and use its previously
	  recorded nexthop information.
	  (ospf_spf_calculate) Vertices are freed simply by deleting
	  vertex_list nodes and letting ospf_vertex_free as deconstructor
	  work per-node.
	  (ospf_spf_calculate_timer) Trivial optimisation, leave
	  backbone SPF calculation till last to reduce SPF churn on
	  VLink updates.
	* ospf_vty.c: (ospf_find_vl_data) update call to ospf_vl_lookup
	  (no_ospf_area_vlink_cmd) ditto.
	  (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) For Vlinks, the peer address is
	  more interesting than the output interface.

2006-04-03 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) Fix issues with handling of Vlinks and entries
	  in the nbrs route-table which were highlighted by the
	  nsm/nbr_self fixes from bug #234. Many thanks to Juergen
	  Kammer for his help and efforts in testing out debug patches to
	  pinpoint the issue.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_vl_new) Add nbr_self for Vlink.
	* ospf_neighbor.c: (ospf_nbr_key) new static function, helper
	  to create key in nbrs table for a given nbr.

	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_lookup_recv_if) Ignore loopbacks,
	  we can never ever receive packets on those. Should fix
	  case where CARP is run with address in same subnet as real
	  interface. Problem report and diagnosis thanks to:
	  Landon Fuller <landonf@opendarwin.org>.
	  However, ospf_read() still can't deal deterministically with
	  multiple interfaces in same subnet.

2006-03-23 Steve Lawson <steve.lawson@aheadcomusa.com>

	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_lsa_install) Fix incorrect byte-order 
	  conversion of OSPF_MAX_SEQUENCE_NUMBER

           Remove redundant break statements from switch clauses
           which return.
           return from main, not exit, cause it annoys SOS.
           Remove stray semi-colons which cause empty-statement
           warnings.

2006-01-18 Juergen Kammer <j.kammer@eurodata.de>

	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_router_lsa_new) dont take reference to the

	  initialisation of nbr_self parameters here.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_new) deleting initialisation of
	  parameters of nbr_self, just rely on call to
	  ospf_nbr_add_self.
	  (ospf_if_cleanup) ditto.

	  undefined effect, assignment of an increment expression.

2006-01-10 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_network_run) checking to see if router-id
	  is set should be on ospf->router_id, not router_id_static.
	  This was causing ospfd to not start if router-id had not
	  been configured statically.
	  (ospf_if_update) ditto.
	* ospf_vty.c: (config_write_ospf_distribute) trim down
	  redundant strings.

	* (general) s/graceful/deferred/ in all files, the former term 
	   is confusing wrt OSPF Graceful-Restart.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_deferred_shutdown_check) dont return
	  a function which returns void. SOS complains about this.
	  (ospf_finish)

          In the per-iface loop, don't ospf_if_up interfaces if
          ID is still not configured. The update function will call
          ospf_if_update anyway.
          (ospf_if_update) ID update timer is gone. Just return if no
          ID is set.
        * ospf_vty.c: (ospf_router_id) call ospf_router_id_update, no
          timer needed.

        * ospf_abr.c: (ospf_abr_announce_network_to_area) check
          returned LSA of ospf_summary_lsa_refresh and print warning if

          (ospf_router_lsa_originate) similar
          (ospf_router_lsa_refresh, ospf_network_lsa_new) similar  
          (ospf_summary_lsa_new) Check ID is valid.
          (ospf_summary_lsa_originate) ditto, and check returned LSA from
           previous function is !NULL.
          (ospf_summary_lsa_refresh) check ospf_summary_lsa_new return
           is !NULL.
          (ospf_summary_asbr_lsa_new) ID valid check.

2005-11-14 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_new) stub-shutdown should just default to
	  unconfigured, too strange otherwise.
	  (ospf_finish_final) t_opaque_lsa_self TIMER_OFF should be
	  preprocessor conditional on HAVE_OPAQUE_LSA.
	* ospfd.h: (struct ospf) remove the SHUTDOWN_DEFAULT define.
	  no longer used, plus it wasn't in range that the command
	  accepted.
	* ospf_zebra.h: Depends on vty.h, include it.

2005-11-11 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_spf.c: (ospf_canonical_nexthops_free) Free only
	  the nexthops pointing to the root vertex. We may visit a
	  vertex twice or the vertex may have some inherited nexthops,
	  if we free other nexthops we could crash.
 
2005-11-04 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_{dump,spf,vty}.c: Oops, use the internal tv_sub
	  function rather than unportable timersub.

	* ospf_dump.c: (ospf_timeval_dump) new function. The guts of
	  ospf_timer_dump, but made to be more dynamic in printing out
	  the relative timeval, sliding the precision printed out

	* ospf_dump.h: export ospf_timeval_dump.
	* ospf_flood.c: (ospf_flood) remove gettimeofday, use
	  the libzebra exported recent_time instead, as it's not
	  terribly critical to have time exactly right - the dropped
	  LSA will be retransmited to us if we don't ACK it.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_ls_upd_timer) Ditto, but here we're
	  not transmitting, just putting LSA back on update transmit list.
	* ospfd.h: delay and holdtimes should be unsigned.
	  Add spf_max_holdtime and spf_hold_multiplier.
	  Update default defines for delay and hold time to be in msec.

	  holdtime ever consecutive SPF run which occurs within holdtime
	  of previous SPF, bounded by spf_max_holdtime.
	* ospf_vty.c: Update spf timers commands.
	  (ospf_timers_spf_set) trivial helper. 
	  (ospf_timers_throttle_spf_cmd) new command to set SPF delay,
	  initial hold and max hold times with millisecond resolution.
	  (ospf_timers_spf_cmd) Deprecated. Accept the old values,
	  convert to msec, truncate to new limits.

2005-10-21 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) OSPF fast, sub-second hello and 1s dead-interval
	  support.
	* ospf_dump.c: (ospf_timer_dump) Print out milliseconds too.

	  millisecs unless they specify the additional length.
	* ospf_interface.h: (struct ospf_interface) new interface param, 
	  fast_hello.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_table_lookup) add brackets,
	  gcc warning fix.

	  (OSPF_HELLO_TIMER_ON) new macro to set hello timer according
	  to whether fast_hello is set.

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_hello) hello-interval is not checked
	  for mismatch if fast_hello is set.
	  (ospf_read) Annoying nit, fix "no ospf_interface" to be debug
	  rather than a warning, as it can be perfectly normal to
	  receive packets when logical subnets are used.
	  (ospf_make_hello) Set hello-interval to 0 if fast-hellos are
	  configured.
	* ospf_vty.c: (ospf_auto_cost_reference_bandwidth) annoying

	  quick.
	  (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) Print the hello-interval 
	  according to whether fast-hello is set or not.
	  Print the extra 5 millisec characters from (ospf_timer_dump)
	  if fast-hello is configured.
	  (ospf_vty_dead_interval_set) new function, common to all
	  forms of dead-interval command, to set dead-interval and
	  fast-hello correctly. If a dead-interval is given, unset

          dead-interval to 1 and fast-hello to given multiplier.
	  (ip_ospf_dead_interval_addr_cmd) use

	  (no_ip_ospf_hello_interval) Bug-fix, unset of hello-interval
	  should set it to OSPF_HELLO_INTERVAL_DEFAULT, not
	  OSPF_ROUTER_DEAD_INTERVAL_DEFAULT.
	  (config_write_interface) Write out fast-hello.
	  (ospf_config_write) Write a comment about 
	  "auto-cost reference-bandwidth" having to be equal on all
	  routers. Hopefully just as noticeable as old practice of
	  writing to vty, but less annoying.
	  (ospf_vty_if_init) install the two new dead-interval
	  commands.
	* ospfd.h: Add defines for OSPF_ROUTER_DEAD_INTERVAL_MINIMAL
	  and OSPF_FAST_HELLO_DEFAULT.

	  specific data, eg the backlink and the parent vertex pointer,
	  and point to the appropriate general struct vertex_nexthop.
	  (struct vertex_nexthop) remove parent vertex pointer, so
	  this struct can be shared across vertices.
	  (struct vertex) rename list child to list children. Remove
	  list of nexthops, replace with list of vertex_parents.
	* ospf_spf.c: (update_stat) trivial, remove cast from void *.
	  (vertex_nexthop_new) remove init of parent - field is gone
          from struct vertex_nexthop.
          (ospf_canonical_nexthops_free) Remove the canonical
          vertex_nexthop memory objects. These are the vertex_nexthops
          attached to the first level of router vertices from the root.
          (vertex_parent_new) new function, create a vertex_parent.
          (vertex_parent_free) ditto, but free it.
          (ospf_vertex_new) Update to match changes to struct vertex.
          (ospf_vertex_free) Recursively free a struct vertex and its
          children. The parent list is used as a reference count.
          vertex_nexthops must be free seperately, if required.
          (ospf_vertex_dump) update to match struct vertex changes.
          Print out backlink of parents too.
          (ospf_vertex_add_parent) ditto.
          (ospf_lsa_has_link) update comment.
          (ospf_nexthop_add_unique) removed, not needed anymore.
          (ospf_nexthop_merge) ditto.
          (ospf_spf_consider_nexthop) renamed to ospf_spf_add_parent.
          Simplified to just create vertex_parent and add it.
          (ospf_spf_flush_parents) new function, flush out the parent
	  list.
	  (ospf_nexthop_calculation) Take the relevant route_lsa_link
	  as an argument, which simplifies things and removes the need
	  for the hack in ospf_nexthop_add_unique - ospf_spf_next
	  already knew exactly which link the cost calculated was for.
	  Update to match struct vertex changes too.
	  (ospf_spf_next) Don't create a vertex for W unnecessarily, if
          it's there's a vertex already created for W, use it, and
          hence there's no need to free it either.
          Update some manipulation/comparisons of distance to match.
          Flush the parent list if a lower cost path is found.
          (ospf_spf_route_free) unused, removed.
          (ospf_spf_dump) match the struct vertex changes, and dump the
          ifname if possible.
          (ospf_spf_calculate) At end of SPF, free the canonical nexthops
          and call ospf_vertex_free on the root vertex to free the
	  entire tree.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_vl_set_params) match struct vertex
          changes.
        * ospf_route.c: (ospf_intra_route_add) ditto
          (ospf_route_copy_nexthops_from_vertex) ditto

	* ospf_api.c: sign warnings.
	* ospf_apiserver.c: sign warning and convert all the struct

	* ospf_dump.c: Remove local hard-coded table ospf_redistributed_proto.
	  (ospf_redist_string) New function implemented using new library
	  function zebra_route_string().  Note that there are a few differences
	  in the output that will result: the new function returns strings
	  that are lower-case, whereas the old table was mixed case.  Also,
	  the old table mapped ZEBRA_ROUTE_OSPF6 to "OSPFv3", whereas the
	  new function returns "ospf6".
	* ospfd.h: Remove extern struct message ospf_redistributed_proto[],
	  and add extern const char *ospf_redist_string(u_int route_type)
	  instead.
	* ospf_asbr.c: (ospf_external_info_add) In two messages, use
	  ospf_redist_string instead of LOOKUP(ospf_redistributed_proto).
	* ospf_vty.c: Remove local hard-coded table distribute_str.
	  (config_write_ospf_redistribute,config_write_ospf_distribute): Use
	  new library function zebra_route_string() instead of distribute_str[].
	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_redistribute_set,ospf_redistribute_unset,
	  ospf_redistribute_default_set,ospf_redistribute_check)
	  In debug messages, use ospf_redist_string() instead of
	  LOOKUP(ospf_redistributed_proto).

2005-08-21 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_vty.c: Make "show ip ospf neighbor xxx" commands work.
	  Interface should be specified by name now.

	  print info about it.

2005-08-05 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_zebra.c: Don't assert/stop before type == ZEBRA_ROUTE_MAX if
	  dealing with routemaps. There is ospf->route_map[ZEBRA_ROUTE_MAX]
	  for default-information.

2005-07-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_abr.c: (ospf_abr_announce_network_to_area) SET_FLAG
	  should be on lsa not old, which may be freed for one thing,
	  obviously.

2005-07-12 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_vty.c: (no_ospf_abr_type_cmd) add standard as a negatable
	  abr_type. default abr_type should be OSPF_ABR_DEFAULT.
	  (ospf_config_write) test whether default abr_type against
	  OSPF_ABR_DEFAULT, rather than any specific ABR_TYPE.

2005-06-20 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_nsm.c: Make database exchange for NSSA database work. 

2005-06-13 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	  (ospf_vertex_add_parent) nexthop and child can not be NULL
	  vertex_nexthop's parent->child list can not be NULL
	  (ospf_spf_next) w and cw are per-loop iteration variables, move
	  declarations into loop body.
	  
2005-06-07 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_apiserver.c: Fix obvious error in notifying clients about ISM
	  changes - oi->ifp->status doesn't give to us info about ISM,
	  oi->state does.

2005-06-01  Akihiro Mizutani  <mizutani@net-chef.net>

	* ospf_ism.c (ospf_elect_bdr/ospf_elect_dr): Fix DR election bug.

2005-05-26 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_abr.c: (ospf_abr_update_aggregate) Fix comment, cost bug itself
	  had been fixed long ago by Sowmini.

2005-05-19 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_table_lookup) Fix a serious bug
	  a less serious one. 
	  1: this function is supposed to lookup
	  entries in the oifs ospf_interface route_table and return either
	  an existing oi or NULL to indicate not found, its caller depends
	  on this, yet this function uses route_node_get which /always/
	  returns a route_node - one is created if none exists. Use
	  route_node_lookup instead. This should fix root cause of the
	  reports of the (ospf_add_to_if) assert being hit.
	  2: oi's are inserted into this table with prefixlength set to
	  /32 (indeed, it should be a hash table, not a route_table),
	  however prefixlength to lookup was not changed, if no valid entry
	  can be inserted other than /32, then nothng but /32 should be
	  looked up. This possibly only worked by fluke..
	  Fix confirmed by 2 reporters (one list, one IRC), definitely a
	  backport candidate once it has been incubated in HEAD for a while.
	  Thanks to Patrick Friedel and Ivan Warren for testing.
	  
2005-05-11 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* (general) Fix memory leaks in opaque AS-scope LSAs, reported and
	  with much debugging done by by scott collins <scollins@agile.tv>.
	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_discard_from_db) dont call
	  ospf_ase_unregister_external_lsa for opaque-lsa's, opaques are
	  never registered with ase in the first place.
	* ospf_packet.c: (general) Disabuse opaque related code of its
          tendency to try gather up things into temporary lists.
          (ospf_ls_upd) remove the temporary lists opaque uses, call
          opaque functions inline, just like all other types.
          (ospf_ls_ack) ditto.
          (ospf_recv_packet) fixup sign warning.
        * ospf_opaque.c: (general) fix the unneeded use of lists, and
          untwist some of the logic.
          (ospf_opaque_self_originated_lsa_received) take a single LSA
          as argument, not a list of them. Remove the list loop. Logic 
          otherwise unchanged.
          (ospf_opaque_ls_ack_received) Mostly ditto. But untwist the logic,
          move the actions up into the switch block, remove the goto's and
          sanitise the logic near the end a bit.
        * ospf_opaque.h: Adjust definitions of aforementioned functions
          in ospf_opaque.c to match.
         
2005-05-07 Yar Tikhiy <yar@comp.chem.msu.su>

	* ospf_network.c: Log ifindex on multicast membership leave/join
	  events.

2005-05-06 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

        * (general) extern and static qualifiers added. 
          unspecified arguments in definitions fixed, typically they should
          be 'void'.
          function casts added for callbacks.
          Guards added to headers which lacked them.
          Proper headers included rather than relying on incomplete
          definitions.
          gcc noreturn function attribute where appropriate.
        * ospf_opaque.c: remove the private definition of ospf_lsa's 
          ospf_lsa_refresh_delay.
        * ospf_lsa.h: export ospf_lsa_refresh_delay
        * ospf_packet.c: (ospf_make_md5_digest) make *auth_key const, 
          correct thing to do - removes need for the casts later.
        * ospf_vty.c: Use vty.h's VTY_GET_INTEGER rather than ospf_vty's
          home-brewed versions, shuts up several warnings.
        * ospf_vty.h: remove VTY_GET_UINT32. VTY_GET_IPV4_ADDRESS and
          VTY_GET_IPV4_PREFIX moved to lib/vty.h.
        * ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_distribute_list_update_timer) hacky
          overloading of the THREAD_ARG pointer should at least use
          uintptr_t.

2005-04-15 Zhipeng Gong <zpgong@cdc.3upsystems.com>

	* ospf_abr.c: (ospf_abr_announce_network_to_area) dont forget
	  to approve LSAs for the case where metric has changed, lsa gets
	  flushed otherwise. (backport candidate).

2005-04-11 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_zebra.c (ospf_zebra_add): Call zclient_send_message instead
	  of writen.

2005-04-02 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) Show ifindex and interface
	  flags to help with debugging.
	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_interface_delete) After deleting, set ifp->ifindex
	  to IFINDEX_INTERNAL.
	  (zebra_interface_if_lookup) Make function static.  Tighten up code.

2005-03-31 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_dump.c: (show_debugging_ospf) Show if ospf event debugging
	  is turned on.

2005-03-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_interface_state_up) If the MTU of an operative
	  interface changes, print a debug message and call ospf_if_reset()
	  to simulate down/up on the interface.
	* ospf_interface.h: Declare new function ospf_if_reset().
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_reset) New function to call ospf_if_down
	  and ospf_if_up for all ospf interfaces attached to an interface.

2005-03-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write_frags) Enhance error message to
	  show MTU.  Also make function static.
	  (ospf_write) Enhance error message to show interface name and MTU.
	  Also make function static.

2005-03-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_vty.c: (show_ip_ospf_interface_sub) Display interface MTU and
	  bandwidth; this is useful for debugging problems.  Also, the function
	  should be static.

2005-03-27 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_snmp.c: Don't crash in snmp query if ospf instance doesn't
	  exist at all.

2005-03-25 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospfd.h: Include log.h, fixes compile with gcc-4.0.

2005-03-13 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_lsa.c: (ospf_lsa_refresh_walker) If the system clock jumps
	  backward, then current time may be less than
	  ospf->lsa_refresher_started.  This was causing invalid values
	  for ospf->lsa_refresh_queue.index resulting in infinite loops.
	  Problem fixed by casting the expression to unsigned before taking
	  the modulus.

2005-02-23 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospfd.h: Add new field struct stream *ibuf to struct ospf.
	* ospfd.c: (ospf_new) Check return code from ospf_sock_init.
	  Allocate ibuf using stream_new(OSPF_MAX_PACKET_SIZE+1).
	  (ospf_finish) Call stream_free(ospf->ibuf.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_read) Call stream_reset(ospf->ibuf) and then
	  pass it to ospf_recv_packet for use in receiving the packet
	  (instead of allocating a new stream for each packet received).
	  Eliminate all calls to stream_free(ibuf).
	  (ospf_recv_packet) The struct stream *ibuf is now passed in as
	  an argument.  No need to use recvfrom to peek at the packet
	  header (to see how big it is), just use ospf->ibuf which is
	  always large enough (this eliminates a system call to recvfrom).
	  Therefore, no need to allocate a stream just for this packet,
	  and no need to free it when done.

2005-02-23 Vincenzo Eramo <eramo at infocom.ing.uniroma1.it>

	* ospf_lsa.h: New flag to the LSA structure for the SPF calculation.
	* ospf_lsdb.h: Export ospf_lsdb_clean_stat() function.

	  candidates. Remove ospf_spf_has_vertex(), ospf_vertex_lookup(),
	  ospf_install_candidate() and ospf_spf_register() functions not needed
	  any more. Update ospf_vertex_new(), ospf_spf_next() and
	  ospf_spf_calculate() functions to use pqueue instead of linked list.

2005-02-21 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_ase.c: Don't show messages related to the ase calculations if
	  we are not debugging.

2005-02-19 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	  to make sure we continue to get incoming messages.

2005-02-15 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_recv_packet) Fix silly error wrt allocating

	* ospf_interface.h: Reduce structure padding by putting new u_char
	  field multicast_memberships in a better spot (grouped with
	  other u_char fields type and state).

2005-02-08 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_interface.h: Improve passive_interface comment.  Add new
	  multicast_memberships bitmask to struct ospf_interface to track

	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_if_set_multicast) New function to configure
	  multicast memberships properly based on the current
	  multicast_memberships status and the current values of the
	  ospf_interface state, type, and passive_interface status.
	  (ospf_if_up) Remove call to ospf_if_add_allspfrouters (this is
	  now handled by ism_change_state's call to ospf_if_set_multicast).
	  (ospf_if_down) Remove call to ospf_if_drop_allspfrouters (now
	  handled by ism_change_state).
	* ospf_ism.c: (ospf_dr_election) Remove logic to join or leave
	  the DRouters multicast group (now handled by ism_change_state's call
	  to ospf_if_set_multicast).
	  (ism_change_state) Add call to ospf_if_set_multicast to change
	  multicast memberships as necessary to reflect the new interface state.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_hello) When a Hello packet is received on a
	  passive interface: 1. Increase the severity of the error message
	  from LOG_INFO to LOG_WARNING; 2. Add more information to the error
	  message (packet destination address and interface address);
	  and 3. If the packet was sent to ospf-all-routers, then try
	  to fix the multicast group memberships.
	  (ospf_read) When a packet is received on an interface whose state
	  is ISM_Down, enhance the warning message to show the packet
	  destination address, and try to update/fix the multicast group
	  memberships if the packet was sent to a multicast address.
	  When a packet is received for ospf-designated-routers, but the
	  current interface state is not DR or BDR, then increase the
	  severity level of the error message from LOG_INFO to LOG_WARNING,
	  and try to fix the multicast group memberships.
	* ospf_vty.c: (ospf_passive_interface) Call ospf_if_set_multicast for

	when deciding if an update will fit.
	(ospf_packet_authspace): Factor out calculation of size required
	for authentication.
	(ospf_make_db_desc): Use ospf_max_packet, not OSPF_MAX_PACKET.

	  normal.

2004-12-29 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_read) Always look up the interface if

2004-11-26 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* ospf_main.c: Remove #include "debug.h" (was not being used, and

2004-11-12 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_ia.c: (process_summary_lsa) Only an ABR has any reason to
          ignore stub area summary default. Even so it seems a strange
          check, add a comment to that effect.

2004-11-04 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospfd.c: (ospf_network_match_iface) revert to previous network
          statement match behaviour.

2004-11-02 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write_frags) remove iov arg, msg already points

	  fixing the unfortunate borkenness introduced in moving of this code 
	  to a function.
	  (ospf_write) remove iovp and fix up call to previous.
	  (ospf_ls_upd_packet_new) cast size to long int - unfortunately 
          glibc's size_t format modifier is not portable.

2004-10-31 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write_frags) Add debug output

	  (ospf_ls_upd_packet_new) print size in debug output when too large
	  packet is encountered.
	* ospf_zebra.c: (ospf_distribute_list_update_timer) Ugly misuse of
	  THREAD_ARG to store an integer, but it should at least use same
          same type to retrieve the value. Assert value is sane.

2004-10-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_network.c: (ospf_sock_init) call neutral setsock_ifindex()
          function.
        * ospf_packet.c: (ospf_read) manually look up ifindex
          if system could not have returned one, eg openbsd, thanks to Rivo
	  Nurges for highlighting problem and fix.

	  remove ntohs that should have dissappeared. Take struct ip
	  as argument, caller has to know there's an IP header at start of
	  stream anyway.
	* ospf_dump.h: update declaration of ospf_ip_header_dump.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write) correct call to 
	  sockopt_iphdrincl_swab_htosys which was munging the header.
	  (ospf_recv_packet) ip_len is needed for old OpenBSD fixup.
	  (ospf_read) sockopt_iphdrincl_swab_systoh ip header as soon as
	  we have it.
	* (global) Const char update and signed/unsigned fixes.
	* (various headers) size defines should be unsigned.
	* ospf_interface.h: remove duplicated defines, include the
	  authoritative header - though, these defines should probably
          be moved to a dedicated header, or ospfd.h.
	* ospf_lsa.h: (struct lsa) ls_seqnum should be unsigned.
	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_write) cast result of shift to unsigned.

	  unsigned, remove unused variables etc.

2004-10-07  Greg Troxel  <gdt@claude.ir.bbn.com>

	* ospf_apiserver.c (ospf_apiserver_unregister_opaque_type): Don't
	use of variable names 'node' and 'nextnode' to avoid possible
	conflict with list macros.  Move variable declaration inside for
	loop after a statement to top of function.

2004-10-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_snmp.c: Missed list typedef update
	* ospf_dump.c: Include sockopt.h for header swab functions.

	* ospf_packet.c: (ospf_swap_iph_to{n,h}) Use
	  HAVE_IP_HDRINCL_BSD_ORDER.
	  (ospf_recv_packet) ditto.
	  (ospf_write) Fixup iov argument to ospf_write_frags.
          (struct msghdr).msg_name is caddr_t on most platforms.
	  (ospf_recv_packet) ditto. And msg_flags is not always there
          memset struct then set fields we care about rather than 
          initialise all fields individually.

2004-09-26 Hasso Tepper <hasso at quagga.net>

	* ospf_abr.c, ospf_dump.c, ospf_lsa.c, ospf_packet.c, ospf_vty.c,

          referenced node in loop.

	  (ospf_write) Add support for IP fragmentation, will only work on
	  linux though, other kernels make it impossible. get rid of the
	  magic 4 constant.  
	  (ospf_make_ls_upd) Bound check to end of stream, not to 
	  interface mtu.  
	  (ospf_ls_upd_packet_new) New function, allocate upd packet
	  taking oversized LSAs into account.
	  (ospf_ls_upd_queue_send) use ospf_ls_upd_packet_new to allocate,
	  rather than statically allocating mtu sized packet buffer, which
	  actually was wrong - it didnt take ip header into account, which
	  should not be included in packet buffer.
	  (ospf_ls_upd_send_queue_event) minor tweaks and remove
	  TODO comment.
	  
2004-08-31  David Wiggins  <dwiggins@bbn.com>

	* ospf_packet.c (ospf_recv_packet): adjust size declaration of
	  buffer used to get interface index so that it compiles on other
	  than Linux and includes the required alignment space.  Probably

2004-08-19 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_packet.c: update to match sockopt renames.
	
2004-08-04 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

2004-07-27 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* ospf_opaque.c: (ospf_opaque_lsa_flush_schedule) do not NULL out
	  the LSA as then free_opaque_info_per_id() can never unlock (and

          (ospf_make_ls_upd) add comment about large LSA problem,
	  indentation cleanup.

	* ospf_neighbor.c: (ospf_neigbour_get) Index ospf_interface

	  above.
	* ospf_interface.c: (ospf_vl_set_params) Catch changes of interface
