# This file tells the frr package which daemons to start.
#
# Entries are in the format: <daemon>=(yes|no|priority)
#   0, "no"  = disabled
#   1, "yes" = highest priority
#   2 .. 10  = lower priorities
#
# For daemons which support multiple instances, a 2nd line listing
# the instances can be added. Eg for ospfd:
#   ospfd=yes
#   ospfd_instances="1,2"
#
# Priorities were suggested by Dancer <dancer@zeor.simegen.com>.
# They're used to start the FRR daemons in more than one step
# (for example start one or two at network initialization and the
# rest later). The number of FRR daemons being small, priorities
# must be between 1 and 9, inclusive (or the initscript has to be
# changed). /etc/init.d/frr then can be started as
#
#   /etc/init.d/frr <start|stop|restart|<priority>>
#
# where priority 0 is the same as 'stop', priority 10 or 'start'
# means 'start all'
#
# Sample configurations for these daemons can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/frr/examples/.
#
# ATTENTION:
#
# When activation a daemon at the first time, a config file, even if it is
# empty, has to be present *and* be owned by the user and group "frr", else
# the daemon will not be started by /etc/init.d/frr. The permissions should
# be u=rw,g=r,o=.
# When using "vtysh" such a config file is also needed. It should be owned by
# group "frrvty" and set to ug=rw,o= though. Check /etc/pam.d/frr, too.
