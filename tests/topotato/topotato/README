this is WORK IN PROGRESS!

there are random pieces missing and other shit is still getting moved around
and restructured!  don't make assumptions!

It should be mostly working;  to run it you need:

  apt-get install graphviz tshark tini python3-lxml python3-typing-extensions
  sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
  mkdir /etc/frr

Also you need a patched pytest-html.

After you set everything up, run:

  ./run_userns.sh --frr-builddir=/path/to/frr/build --log-cli-level=DEBUG -v -v -x

(you do NOT need to install FRR, it's executed from a source/build directory.)
You can also put frr-builddir in pytest.ini (example included.)

REQUIREMENTS:
- python >= 3.8 (3.6 used to work but not actively tested)
- pytest >= 6.0
- graphviz
- tshark
- dumpcap
- tini
- iproute2 >= 4.17
- python lxml
- typing-extensions (only for python 3.6 & 3.7, built-in for 3.8 and newer)
