	This script runs the FRRouting topotests on the FRR tree
	in the current working directory.

	Usage: $0 [args...]

	If any arguments are provided and the first argument starts with / or ./
	the arguments are interpreted as command and will be executed instead
	of pytest.

	Behavior can be further modified by the following environment variables:

	TOPOTEST_AUTOLOAD       If set to 1, the script will try to load necessary
	                        kernel modules without asking for confirmation first.

	TOPOTEST_NOLOAD         If set to 1, don't try to load necessary kernel
	                        modules and don't even ask.

	TOPOTEST_BUILDCACHE     Docker volume used for caching multiple FRR builds
	                        over container runs. By default a
	                        \`topotest-buildcache\` volume will be created for
	                        that purpose.

	TOPOTEST_CLEAN          Clean all previous build artifacts prior to
	                        building. Disabled by default, set to 1 to enable.

	TOPOTEST_DOC            Build the documentation associated with FRR.
	                        Disabled by default, set to 1 to enable.

	TOPOTEST_FRR            If set, don't test the FRR in the current working
	                        directory, but the one at the given path.

	TOPOTEST_LOGS           If set, don't use \`/tmp/topotest_logs\` directory
	                        but use the provided path instead.

	TOPOTEST_OPTIONS        These options are appended to the docker-run
	                        command for starting the tests.

	TOPOTEST_PULL           If set to 0, don't try to pull the most recent
	                        version of the docker image from dockerhub.

	TOPOTEST_SANITIZER      Controls whether to use the address sanitizer.
	                        Enabled by default, set to 0 to disable.

	TOPOTEST_VERBOSE        Show detailed build output.
	                        Enabled by default, set to 0 to disable.
