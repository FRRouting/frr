Welcome to the topotests container.

Here are some useful tips:
* After changing the FRR/Topotests sources, you may rebuild them
  using the command `compile_frr.sh`. The build command has the
  following environment variables:
  - TOPOTEST_CLEAN: whether we should distclean or not (disabled by default)
  - TOPOTEST_VERBOSE: show build messages (enabled by default)
  - TOPOTEST_DOC: whether we should build docs or not (disabled by default)
  - TOPOTEST_SANITIZER: whether we should use the address sanitizer (enabled by default)

  Usage example: env TOPOTEST_CLEAN=1 compile_frr.sh

* The topotests log directory can be found on your host machine on
  `/tmp/topotests_logs`.
