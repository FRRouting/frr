	* test-buffer.c: include memory.h
          (main) call memory_init().
	
2004-09-05 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy-wq.c: (slow_func_del,slow_func_err) make them take
	  void * argument to shut up silly gcc warning.
	  
2004-05-25 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* main.c: new file, common 'main' portion which then calls
	  test_init.
	* heavy.c: remove common portions now in 'main.
	* heavy-wq.c: ditto
	* heavy-thread.c: ditto
	* heavy*.c: Set the slow_function iteration number lower, to 300, it
	  was several orders of magnitude too 'slow' to be useful. :)
	* Makefile.am: main is a source of the tests. heavy should link
	  to the math library.

	* heavy-thread.c: Andrew Schorr's adaptation of heavy.c to use a
	  background thread to avoid responsiveness problems.
	* Makefile.am: Build heavythread

2004-05-21 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy.c: Add a timer thread to demonstrate thread interactivity,
	  Add a daemon_exit command to assist with debugging (eg for memory
	  tracers, etc..)

2004-05-19 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy.c: test programme to show how long-running functions
	  kill responsiveness. Demonstrating the most niggly problem 
	  left in bgpd.

2004-05-13 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* test-buffer.c: Andrew's buffer tester
	* test-memory.c: basic memory tester
	* Makefile.am: Add new tests
