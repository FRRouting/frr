Integrated config wins
======================


The use of split-configuration setups (zebra.conf, staticd.conf, bgpd.conf,
etc.) in FRR is considered deprecated and will go away at some point.

At this point there is no timeline yet on removing split-config support, and
this needs to go through an extensive deprecation period with increasingly
loud user warnings.
