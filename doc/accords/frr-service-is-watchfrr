The "FRR" service unit is watchfrr
==================================


"FRR" on the distribution/OS level is one service (generally called "frr").
Exposing individual daemons (zebra, staticd, bgpd, ...) as service units does
not match FRR's internal expectations.

At some future point, watchfrr will add functionality to receive "router bgp",
"router ospf" etc. commands (or their YANG variants) and automatically start
the required daemons.  In particular with multi-instance setups, this will
simplify config (no more mucking around /etc/frr/daemons - if watchfrr
understands which daemons are needed by a given config, the daemons file is
pointless.)

This to some degree assumes an "integrated-config world".
