Transactional CLI
-----------------

This short demo shows some of the capabilities of the new transactional
CLI: |asciicast|

ConfD + NETCONF + Cisco YDK
---------------------------

This is a very simple demo of *ripd* being configured by a python
script. The script uses NETCONF to communicate with *ripd*, which has
the ConfD plugin loaded. The most interesting part, however, is the fact
that the python script is not using handcrafted XML payloads to
configure *ripd*. Instead, the script is using python bindings generated
using Ciscoâ€™s YANG Development Kit (YDK).
