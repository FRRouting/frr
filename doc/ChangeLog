	* bgpd.texi: Document new "bgp bestpath as-path confed" command.

2005-04-05 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: Get rid of built_sources. It causes them to be added
	  to dist, and the dist host can not generate the PDFs.

2005-04-02 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* fig{-{normal,rs}-processing,_topologies_{rs,full}}.dia: new
          files, dia diagramme XML versions of the original corresponding
          EPS encapsulated bitmaps.

	  replaced by above dia source.
	* routeserver.texi: remove extension in image macros.
	* quagga.info: updated build
	* Makefile.am: Add rules to build eps (using 'convert'), png (using
	  dia). Add figures_BUILT_SOURCES to extra_dist to avoid the 
	  dependency on dia :) (amongst other things) for dist users.
	  quagga_TEXINFOS should depend on figures_BUILT_SOURCES.
	* .cvsignore: ignore eps files, built from sources
	* Makefile.am: Urg, dont use automake _SOURCES, _BUILT_SOURCES
	  for figures, automake doesnt know anything about them.
	  
2005-03-25 Jean-Mickael Guerin <jean-mickael.guerin@6wind.com>

	* routeserver.texi: Strip ctrl-M from line endings, note by
	  sigma@smx.pair.com
	* quagga.info: Add generated file to CVS, as it requires most recent
          texinfo to build, until such time as texinfo 4.7 is more
          prevalent.

2004-11-08 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: Add routeserver.texi to quagga_TEXINFOS.
	  Add quagga.info to clean files list (would have thought automake
          would have done this, but it doesnt seem to)

2004-11-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* quagga.texi: include routeserver.texi. TODO: integrate the current
          multiple-instance orientated bgpd route-server section with the
          new route-server docs.

2004-11-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: Add automatic rule to build pdf's from eps figures.
	  Clean *.pdf. Add rule for quagga.pdf (as the eps.pdf pattern
          probably otherwise will override automake's rule for quagga.pdf)
	* overview.texi: URL was causing TeX overfull, put on newline.
	* quagga.texi: Put the copyright notice into @copying section, as
	  is proper. Strip trailling space from the main menu lines.
	* rip(ng)?d.texi: Minor reformatting.

	* bgpd.texi: remove unneeded page breaks. The 6Bone example
          overflows though.
	* routeserver.texi: new file, texinfo'fied and slightly modified 
          version of the original TeX from James Luis Rubio.
	* fig-*.eps: new files, diagrammes.
        
2004-11-06 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* defines.texi.in: New file, texi variables should be set here,
          autoconf substitution is available. Define common AUTHORS,
          COPYRIGHT_YEAR and COPYRIGHT_STR vars.
	* (global): Make use of makeinfo node pointer auto-creation
          to avoid having to fully specify links for nodes, so we only have
          to specify current node name - simplifies text slightly.
          Remove extraneous newlines which appear to cause extra blank pages
          to be added in output.
          Update copyright strings which appear in various places to
          use the new COPYRIGHT_STR texinfo variable.
	  Change url to uref, the former need not output an actual
	  hyperlink depending on version of texinfo, the latter should if
	  supported by the format (eg PDF).
	* texinfo.tex: Update to a more recent version. previous file
	  was many many years old. This file should possibly be removed
          altogether, and allowed to be installed by automake.
        * quagga.texi: Make use of automake's version.texi feature to
          have VERSION and some other vars auto-defined. include
          defines.texi. Change copyright strings to use the COPYRIGHT_STR
          variable.
	* install.texi: Make the privs section an actual section. Ditto for
	  the Linux notes.
	* overview.texi: Supply URL for Quagga, where format allows. Tidy up
          one or two paragraphs slightly.
	  Update the section on supported platforms.
	  Remove the ZNOG list stuff, direct reader to the website for
          further information on email lists.
	* vtysh.texi: Update the integrated config file section. Make the
	  commands sections so correct PDF indexes are built.

	copying CVS files, per the automake manual's recommendations.
