.SH DESCRIPTION
@PACKAGE_NAME@ daemons share a large part of their command line options;
this man page documents these.  For options on specific daemons please refer
to their respective man pages.  Most of the common options are related to
process control, configuration and common library functionality.

.SH HELP AND VERSION
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a short description of the daemon's command line options.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and build information for the daemon.
.PP
Both of these options inhibit normal operation and will immediately exit.

.SH PROCESS CONTROL
These options control background operation:
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemon\fR
Launches the process in background/daemon mode, forking and detaching from
the terminal.

The parent process will delay its exit until the daemon/child has finished
its initialization and has entered its main loop.  This is important for
\fBzebra\fR startup because the other daemons will attempt to connect to
\fBzebra\fR.  A return from \fBzebra -d\fR guarantees its readiness to
accept these connections.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-terminal\fR
Opens an interactive VTY session on the terminal, allowing for both state
and configuration operations.  Note that the terminal starts operating after
startup has completed and the configuration file has been loaded.

The process will exit when end of file is detected on the terminal.  It is
possible to daemonize a process started with \fB-t\fR (but without \fB-d\fR)
by sending \fISIGQUIT\fR to the process (normally mapped to a \fI^\\\fR
keypress.)
.TP
\fB\-dt\fR, \fB\-\-daemon \-\-terminal\fR
This combination of the previous two options will delay the daemon from
going into background until the terminal session ends (by end of file.)

If the process receives \fISIGINT\fR (e.g. a \fI^C\fR keypress) in this
mode, it will exit instead of daemonizing.
.PP
It is safe to suspend (\fISIGTSTP\fR / \fI^Z\fR) the terminal session
opened by the previous two options;  this will only stop the terminal but
not the protocol daemon itself (which runs in a separate second process.)

.SH CONFIGURATION AND PATHS
The following options control configuration and file system locations for
@PACKAGE_NAME@ processes:
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-config_file\fR \fIconfig-file\fR
Specify a configuration file to be used instead of the default 
\fB\fI@CFG_SYSCONF@/<daemon>.conf\fR file.

Note that the daemon will attempt to write to this file if the
\fIwrite file\fR command is issued on its VTY interface or through
\fBvtysh\fR.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-dryrun\fR
Load the configuration file and check its validity, then exit.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-pid_file\fR \fIpid-file\fR
Output a pid file to a location other than the default 
\fB\fI@CFG_STATE@/<daemon>.pid\fR.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-socket\fR \fIzclient-path\fR
Override the path of the ZAPI socket used to communicate between \fBzebra\fR
and the various protocol daemons. The default is
\fB\fI@CFG_STATE@/zserv.api\fR.  The value of this option must be the same
across all daemons.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-pathspace\fR \fIpathspace\fR
Insert \fIpathspace\fR into all default paths, changing the defaults to:
.IP
\fB@CFG_SYSCONF@/\fIpathspace\fB/<daemon>.conf\fR
.br
\fB@CFG_STATE@/\fIpathspace\fB/<daemon>.pid\fR
.br
\fB@CFG_STATE@/\fIpathspace\fB/<daemon>.vty\fR
.br
\fB@CFG_STATE@/\fIpathspace\fB/zserv.api\fR

\'.\' and \'/\' characters will not be accepted in \fIpathspace\fR, but the
empty string will be accepted.

Note that this only changes the respective defaults, it has no effect on
the respective path if the \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-i\fR, \fB\-z\fR or
\fB\-\-vty_socket\fR options are used.

The purpose of this option is to easily group all file system related
bits together for running multiple fully-separate "logical routers" on a
system, particularly with Linux network namespaces.  Groups of daemons
running with distinct \fIpathspace\fR values will be completely unaware
of each other and not interact in any way.

This option does not do any system setup (like network namespaces.) This
must be done by the user, for example by running:
.IP
\fBip netns exec \fInamespace \fB<daemon> -N \fInamespace\fR

.SH PROCESS CREDENTIALS
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR \fIuser\fR
(default: \fB@enable_user@\fR)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-group\fR \fIgroup\fR
(default: \fB@enable_group@\fR)
.IP
Change the user/group which the daemon will switch to.
.PP
Note that there is an additional group, \fB@enable_vty_group@\fR, which
controls group ownership of the VTY sockets.  The name of this group cannot
currently be changed, and \fIuser\fR must be a member of this group.

.SH VTY SETUP
These following options control the daemon's VTY (interactive command line)
interface.  The interface is available over TCP, using the telnet protocol,
as well as through the \fBvtysh\fR frontend.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB--vty_addr\fR \fIvty-addr\fR
Specify an IP/IPv6 address to bind the TCP VTY interface to.  It is
generally recommended to specify \fI::1\fR or \fI127.0.0.1\fR.  For reasons
of backwards compatibility, the default is to listen on all interfaces.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB--vty_port\fR \fIvty-port\fR
Override the daemon's default TCP VTY port (each daemon has a different
default value upwards of 2600, listed below.)  Specifying \fI0\fR disables
the TCP VTY interface.

Default ports are:

.ta 16m
zebra	2601
.br
ripd	2602
.br
ripngd	2603
.br
ospfd	2604
.br
bgpd	2605
.br
ospf6d	2606
.br
isisd	2608
.br
babeld	2609
.br
nhrpd	2610
.br
pimd	2611
.br
ldpd	2612
.br
eigrpd	2613

Port 2607 is used for ospfd's Opaque LSA API, while port 2600 is used for
the (insecure) TCP-ZEBRA interface.
.TP
\fB\-\-vty_socket\fR \fIvty-path\fR
Overrides the directory used for the \fB<daemon>.vty\fR sockets.
\fBvtysh\fR connects to these sockets in order to access each daemon's
VTY.
.br
Default: \fB\fI@CFG_STATE@\fR[\fB/\fI<pathspace>\fR]

NB: Unlike the other options, this option specifies a \fBdirectory\fR,
not a full path.

This option is primarily used by the SNAP packaging system, its semantics
may change.  It should not be neccessary in most other scenarios.

.SH MODULE LOADING
@PACKAGE_NAME@ supports optional dynamically loadable modules, although
these can only be loaded at startup.  The set of available modules may vary
across distributions and packages, and modules may be available for
installation as separate packages.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR \fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIoptions\fR]
Load a module named \fImodule\fR, optionally passing \fIoptions\fR to it.

If there is a \'/\' character in \fImodule\fR, the value is assumed to be
a pathname to a module.

If there is no \'/\' character, the module directory (see next option)
is searched first for a module named "\fI<daemon>\fB_\fI<module>\fB.so\fR",
then for "\fI<module>\fB.so\fR".
This allows for a module to exist in variations appropriate for particular
daemons, e.g. \fIzebra_snmp\fR and \fIbgp_snmp\fR, with the correct one
selected by \fI\-M snmp\fR.

The meaning of \fIoptions\fR is specific to the module being loaded.  Most
modules currently ignore it.

Modules are loaded in the order as listed on the command line.  This is
not generally relevant.
.TP
\fB\-\-moduledir\fR \fImodule-path\fR
Look for modules in the \fImodule-path\fR directory instead of the default
\fI@CFG_MODULE@\fR.  (This path is \fBnot\fR affected by the \fB\-N\fR
option.)
.PP
The list of loaded modules can be inspected at runtime with the
\fBshow modules\fR VTY command.
