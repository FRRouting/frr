SYNOPSIS
========
|DAEMON| |synopsis-options-hv|

|DAEMON| |synopsis-options|

DESCRIPTION
===========
|DAEMON| is a routing component that works with the FRRouting routing engine.

OPTIONS
=======
OPTIONS available for the |DAEMON| command:

.. include:: common-options.rst

.. option:: -p, --bgp_port <port>

   Set the bgp protocol's port number. When port number is 0, that means do not
   listen bgp port.

.. option:: -l, --listenon

   Specify a specific IP address for bgpd to listen on, rather than its default
   of ``0.0.0.0`` / ``::``. This can be useful to constrain bgpd to an internal
   address, or to run multiple bgpd processes on one host.

.. option:: -n, --no_kernel

   Do not install learned routes into the linux kernel.  This option is useful
   for a route-reflector environment or if you are running multiple bgp
   processes in the same namespace.  This option is different than the --no_zebra
   option in that a ZAPI connection is made.

.. option:: -e, --ecmp

   Run BGP with a limited ecmp capability, that is different than what BGP
   was compiled with.  The value specified must be greater than 0 and less
   than or equal to the MULTIPATH_NUM specified on compilation.

.. option:: -Z, --no_zebra

   Do not communicate with zebra at all.  This is different than the --no_kernel
   option in that we do not even open a ZAPI connection to the zebra process.

.. option:: -s, --socket_size

   When opening tcp connections to our peers, set the socket send buffer
   size that the kernel will use for the peers socket.  This option
   is only really useful at a very large scale.  Experimentation should
   be done to see if this is helping or not at the scale you are running
   at.

LABEL MANAGER
-------------

.. option:: -I, --int_num

   Set zclient id. This is required when using Zebra label manager in proxy mode.
