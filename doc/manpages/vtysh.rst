SYNOPSIS
========
vtysh [ -b ]

vtysh [ -E ] [ -d *daemon* ] [ -c *command* ]

DESCRIPTION
===========
vtysh is an integrated shell for the FRRouting suite of protocol daemons.

OPTIONS
=======
OPTIONS available for the vtysh command:

.. option:: -b, --boot

   Execute boot startup configuration. It makes sense only if integrated config file is in use (not default in FRRouting). See Info file frr for more info.

.. option:: -c, --command command

   Specify command to be executed under batch mode. It behaves like -c option in any other shell - command is executed and vtysh exits.

   It's useful for gathering info from FRRouting daemons or reconfiguring daemons from inside shell scripts, etc. Note that multiple commands may be executed by using more than one -c option and/or embedding linefeed characters inside the command string.

.. option:: -d, --daemon daemon_name

   Specify which daemon to connect to. By default, vtysh attempts to connect to all FRRouting daemons running on the system. With this flag, one can specify a single daemon to connect to instead. For example, specifying '-d ospfd' will connect only to ospfd. This can be particularly useful inside scripts with -c where the command is targeted for a single daemon.

.. option:: -e, --execute command

   Alias for -c. It's here only for compatibility with Zebra routing software and older FRR versions. This will be removed in future.

.. option:: -E, --echo

   When the -c option is being used, this flag will cause the standard vtysh prompt and command to be echoed prior to displaying the results. This is particularly useful to separate the results when executing multiple commands.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Display a usage message on standard output and exit.
