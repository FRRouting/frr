.SH NAME
mtracebis \- a program to initiate multicast traceroute "mtrace" queries
.SH SYNOPSIS
mtracebis
<multicast source>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mtracebis
is a program used to test multicast connectivity in a multicast and multicast
traceroute enabled IP network.
.PP
Initial version of the program requires multicast source IP address and
initiates a weak traceroute across the network. This tests whether the
interfaces towards the source are multicast enabled. First query sent is a
full query, capable of crossing the network all the way to the source. If this
fails, hop-by-hop queries are initiated.
.PP
Hop-by-hop queries start by requesting only a response from the nearest router.
Following that, next query is extended to the next two routers, and so on...
until a set of routers is tested for connectivity.
