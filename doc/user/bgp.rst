.. _bgp:

***
BGP
***

:abbr:`BGP` stands for Border Gateway Protocol. The latest BGP version is 4.
BGP-4 is one of the Exterior Gateway Protocols and the de facto standard
interdomain routing protocol. BGP-4 is described in :rfc:`1771` and updated by
:rfc:`4271`. :rfc:`2858` adds multiprotocol support to BGP-4.

.. _starting-bgp:

Starting BGP
============

The default configuration file of *bgpd* is :file:`bgpd.conf`. *bgpd* searches
the current directory first, followed by |INSTALL_PREFIX_ETC|/bgpd.conf. All of
*bgpd*'s commands must be configured in :file:`bgpd.conf` when the integrated
config is not being used.

*bgpd* specific invocation options are described below. Common options may also
be specified (:ref:`common-invocation-options`).

.. program:: bgpd

.. option:: -p, --bgp_port <port>

   Set the bgp protocol's port number. When port number is 0, that means do not
   listen bgp port.

.. option:: -l, --listenon

   Specify a specific IP address for bgpd to listen on, rather than its default
   of ``0.0.0.0`` / ``::``. This can be useful to constrain bgpd to an internal
   address, or to run multiple bgpd processes on one host.

.. option:: -n, --no_kernel

   Do not install learned routes into the linux kernel.  This option is useful
   for a route-reflector environment or if you are running multiple bgp
   processes in the same namespace.  This option is different than the --no_zebra
   option in that a ZAPI connection is made.

.. option:: -S, --skip_runas

   Skip the normal process of checking capabilities and changing user and group
   information.

.. option:: -e, --ecmp

   Run BGP with a limited ecmp capability, that is different than what BGP
   was compiled with.  The value specified must be greater than 0 and less
   than or equal to the MULTIPATH_NUM specified on compilation.

.. option:: -Z, --no_zebra

   Do not communicate with zebra at all.  This is different than the --no_kernel
   option in that we do not even open a ZAPI connection to the zebra process.

.. option:: -s, --socket_size

   When opening tcp connections to our peers, set the socket send buffer
   size that the kernel will use for the peers socket.  This option
   is only really useful at a very large scale.  Experimentation should
   be done to see if this is helping or not at the scale you are running
   at.

LABEL MANAGER
-------------

.. option:: -I, --int_num

   Set zclient id. This is required when using Zebra label manager in proxy mode.

.. _bgp-basic-concepts:

Basic Concepts
==============

.. _bgp-autonomous-systems:

Autonomous Systems
------------------

From :rfc:`1930`:

   An AS is a connected group of one or more IP prefixes run by one or more
   network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing policy.

Each AS has an identifying number associated with it called an :abbr:`ASN
(Autonomous System Number)`. This is a two octet value ranging in value from 1
to 65535. The AS numbers 64512 through 65535 are defined as private AS numbers.
Private AS numbers must not be advertised on the global Internet.

The :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` is one of the essential elements of
BGP. BGP is a distance vector routing protocol, and the AS-Path framework
provides distance vector metric and loop detection to BGP.

.. seealso:: :rfc:`1930`

.. _bgp-address-families:

Address Families
----------------

Multiprotocol extensions enable BGP to carry routing information for multiple
network layer protocols. BGP supports an Address Family Identifier (AFI) for
IPv4 and IPv6. Support is also provided for multiple sets of per-AFI
information via the BGP Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). FRR
supports SAFIs for unicast information, labeled information (:rfc:`3107` and
:rfc:`8277`), and Layer 3 VPN information (:rfc:`4364` and :rfc:`4659`).

.. _bgp-route-selection:

Route Selection
---------------

The route selection process used by FRR's BGP implementation uses the following
decision criterion, starting at the top of the list and going towards the
bottom until one of the factors can be used.

1. **Weight check**

   Prefer higher local weight routes to lower routes.

2. **Local preference check**

   Prefer higher local preference routes to lower.

3. **Local route check**

   Prefer local routes (statics, aggregates, redistributed) to received routes.

4. **AS path length check**

   Prefer shortest hop-count AS_PATHs.

5. **Origin check**

   Prefer the lowest origin type route. That is, prefer IGP origin routes to
   EGP, to Incomplete routes.

6. **MED check**

   Where routes with a MED were received from the same AS, prefer the route
   with the lowest MED. :ref:`bgp-med`.

7. **External check**

   Prefer the route received from an external, eBGP peer over routes received
   from other types of peers.

8. **IGP cost check**

   Prefer the route with the lower IGP cost.

9. **Multi-path check**

   If multi-pathing is enabled, then check whether the routes not yet
   distinguished in preference may be considered equal. If
   :clicmd:`bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax` is set, all such routes are
   considered equal, otherwise routes received via iBGP with identical AS_PATHs
   or routes received from eBGP neighbours in the same AS are considered equal.

10. **Already-selected external check**

    Where both routes were received from eBGP peers, then prefer the route
    which is already selected. Note that this check is not applied if
    :clicmd:`bgp bestpath compare-routerid` is configured. This check can
    prevent some cases of oscillation.

11. **Router-ID check**

    Prefer the route with the lowest `router-ID`. If the route has an
    `ORIGINATOR_ID` attribute, through iBGP reflection, then that router ID is
    used, otherwise the `router-ID` of the peer the route was received from is
    used.

12. **Cluster-List length check**

    The route with the shortest cluster-list length is used. The cluster-list
    reflects the iBGP reflection path the route has taken.

13. **Peer address**

    Prefer the route received from the peer with the higher transport layer
    address, as a last-resort tie-breaker.

.. _bgp-capability-negotiation:

Capability Negotiation
----------------------

When adding IPv6 routing information exchange feature to BGP. There were some
proposals. :abbr:`IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)`
:abbr:`IDR (Inter Domain Routing)` adopted a proposal called Multiprotocol
Extension for BGP. The specification is described in :rfc:`2283`. The protocol
does not define new protocols. It defines new attributes to existing BGP. When
it is used exchanging IPv6 routing information it is called BGP-4+. When it is
used for exchanging multicast routing information it is called MBGP.

*bgpd* supports Multiprotocol Extension for BGP. So if a remote peer supports
the protocol, *bgpd* can exchange IPv6 and/or multicast routing information.

Traditional BGP did not have the feature to detect a remote peer's
capabilities, e.g. whether it can handle prefix types other than IPv4 unicast
routes. This was a big problem using Multiprotocol Extension for BGP in an
operational network. :rfc:`2842` adopted a feature called Capability
Negotiation. *bgpd* use this Capability Negotiation to detect the remote peer's
capabilities. If a peer is only configured as an IPv4 unicast neighbor, *bgpd*
does not send these Capability Negotiation packets (at least not unless other
optional BGP features require capability negotiation).

By default, FRR will bring up peering with minimal common capability for the
both sides. For example, if the local router has unicast and multicast
capabilities and the remote router only has unicast capability the local router
will establish the connection with unicast only capability. When there are no
common capabilities, FRR sends Unsupported Capability error and then resets the
connection.

.. _bgp-router-configuration:

BGP Router Configuration
========================

ASN and Router ID
-----------------

First of all you must configure BGP router with the :clicmd:`router bgp ASN`
command. The AS number is an identifier for the autonomous system. The BGP
protocol uses the AS number for detecting whether the BGP connection is
internal or external.

.. index:: router bgp ASN
.. clicmd:: router bgp ASN

   Enable a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN. After
   this statement you can input any `BGP Commands`.

.. index:: no router bgp ASN
.. clicmd:: no router bgp ASN

   Destroy a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN.

.. index:: bgp router-id A.B.C.D
.. clicmd:: bgp router-id A.B.C.D

   This command specifies the router-ID. If *bgpd* connects to *zebra* it gets
   interface and address information. In that case default router ID value is
   selected as the largest IP Address of the interfaces. When `router zebra` is
   not enabled *bgpd* can't get interface information so `router-id` is set to
   0.0.0.0. So please set router-id by hand.


.. _bgp-multiple-autonomous-systems:

Multiple Autonomous Systems
---------------------------

FRR's BGP implementation is capable of running multiple autonomous systems at
once. Each configured AS corresponds to a :ref:`zebra-vrf`. In the past, to get
the same functionality the network administrator had to run a new *bgpd*
process; using VRFs allows multiple autonomous systems to be handled in a
single process.

When using multiple autonomous systems, all router config blocks after the
first one must specify a VRF to be the target of BGP's route selection. This
VRF must be unique within respect to all other VRFs being used for the same
purpose, i.e. two different autonomous systems cannot use the same VRF.
However, the same AS can be used with different VRFs.

.. note::

   The separated nature of VRFs makes it possible to peer a single *bgpd*
   process to itself, on one machine. Note that this can be done fully within
   BGP without a corresponding VRF in the kernel or Zebra, which enables some
   practical use cases such as :ref:`route reflectors <bgp-route-reflector>`
   and route servers.

Configuration of additional autonomous systems, or of a router that targets a
specific VRF, is accomplished with the following command:

.. index:: router bgp ASN vrf VRFNAME
.. clicmd:: router bgp ASN vrf VRFNAME

   ``VRFNAME`` is matched against VRFs configured in the kernel. When ``vrf
   VRFNAME`` is not specified, the BGP protocol process belongs to the default
   VRF.

An example configuration with multiple autonomous systems might look like this:

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 1
    neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 20
    neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 30
   !
   router bgp 2 vrf blue
    neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 40
    neighbor 10.0.0.4 remote-as 50
   !
   router bgp 3 vrf red
    neighbor 10.0.0.5 remote-as 60
    neighbor 10.0.0.6 remote-as 70
   ...

.. seealso:: :ref:`bgp-vrf-route-leaking`
.. seealso:: :ref:`zebra-vrf`


.. _bgp-views:

Views
-----

In addition to supporting multiple autonomous systems, FRR's BGP implementation
also supports *views*.

BGP views are almost the same as normal BGP processes, except that routes
selected by BGP are not installed into the kernel routing table.  Each BGP view
provides an independent set of routing information which is only distributed
via BGP. Multiple views can be supported, and BGP view information is always
independent from other routing protocols and Zebra/kernel routes. BGP views use
the core instance (i.e., default VRF) for communication with peers.

.. index:: router bgp AS-NUMBER view NAME
.. clicmd:: router bgp AS-NUMBER view NAME

   Make a new BGP view. You can use an arbitrary word for the ``NAME``. Routes
   selected by the view are not installed into the kernel routing table.

   With this command, you can setup Route Server like below.

   .. code-block:: frr

      !
      router bgp 1 view 1
       neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
       neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 3
      !
      router bgp 2 view 2
       neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 4
       neighbor 10.0.0.4 remote-as 5

.. index:: show [ip] bgp view NAME
.. clicmd:: show [ip] bgp view NAME

   Display the routing table of BGP view ``NAME``.


Route Selection
---------------

.. index:: bgp bestpath as-path confed
.. clicmd:: bgp bestpath as-path confed

   This command specifies that the length of confederation path sets and
   sequences should should be taken into account during the BGP best path
   decision process.

.. index:: bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
.. clicmd:: bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax

   This command specifies that BGP decision process should consider paths
   of equal AS_PATH length candidates for multipath computation. Without
   the knob, the entire AS_PATH must match for multipath computation.

.. clicmd:: bgp bestpath compare-routerid

   Ensure that when comparing routes where both are equal on most metrics,
   including local-pref, AS_PATH length, IGP cost, MED, that the tie is broken
   based on router-ID.

   If this option is enabled, then the already-selected check, where
   already selected eBGP routes are preferred, is skipped.

   If a route has an `ORIGINATOR_ID` attribute because it has been reflected,
   that `ORIGINATOR_ID` will be used. Otherwise, the router-ID of the peer the
   route was received from will be used.

   The advantage of this is that the route-selection (at this point) will be
   more deterministic. The disadvantage is that a few or even one lowest-ID
   router may attract all traffic to otherwise-equal paths because of this
   check. It may increase the possibility of MED or IGP oscillation, unless
   other measures were taken to avoid these. The exact behaviour will be
   sensitive to the iBGP and reflection topology.

.. _bgp-distance:

Administrative Distance Metrics
-------------------------------

.. index:: distance bgp (1-255) (1-255) (1-255)
.. clicmd:: distance bgp (1-255) (1-255) (1-255)

   This command change distance value of BGP. The arguments are the distance
   values for for external routes, internal routes and local routes
   respectively.

.. index:: distance (1-255) A.B.C.D/M
.. clicmd:: distance (1-255) A.B.C.D/M

.. index:: distance (1-255) A.B.C.D/M WORD
.. clicmd:: distance (1-255) A.B.C.D/M WORD

   Sets the administrative distance for a particular route.

.. _bgp-requires-policy:

Require policy on EBGP
-------------------------------

.. index:: [no] bgp ebgp-requires-policy
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp ebgp-requires-policy

   This command requires incoming and outgoing filters to be applied
   for eBGP sessions. Without the incoming filter, no routes will be
   accepted. Without the outgoing filter, no routes will be announced.

   This is enabled by default.

   When the incoming or outgoing filter is missing you will see
   "(Policy)" sign under ``show bgp summary``:

   .. code-block:: frr

      exit1# show bgp summary

      IPv4 Unicast Summary:
      BGP router identifier 10.10.10.1, local AS number 65001 vrf-id 0
      BGP table version 4
      RIB entries 7, using 1344 bytes of memory
      Peers 2, using 43 KiB of memory

      Neighbor        V         AS   MsgRcvd   MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State/PfxRcd   PfxSnt
      192.168.0.2     4      65002         8        10        0    0    0 00:03:09            5 (Policy)
      fe80:1::2222    4      65002         9        11        0    0    0 00:03:09     (Policy) (Policy)

Reject routes with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET types
------------------------------------------------

.. index:: [no] bgp reject-as-sets
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp reject-as-sets

   This command enables rejection of incoming and outgoing routes having AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET type.

Disable checking if nexthop is connected on EBGP sessions
---------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: [no] bgp disable-ebgp-connected-route-check
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp disable-ebgp-connected-route-check

   This command is used to disable the connection verification process for EBGP peering sessions
   that are reachable by a single hop but are configured on a loopback interface or otherwise
   configured with a non-directly connected IP address.

.. _bgp-route-flap-dampening:

Route Flap Dampening
--------------------

.. clicmd:: bgp dampening (1-45) (1-20000) (1-20000) (1-255)

   This command enables BGP route-flap dampening and specifies dampening parameters.

   half-life
      Half-life time for the penalty

   reuse-threshold
      Value to start reusing a route

   suppress-threshold
      Value to start suppressing a route

   max-suppress
      Maximum duration to suppress a stable route

   The route-flap damping algorithm is compatible with :rfc:`2439`. The use of
   this command is not recommended nowadays.

   At the moment, route-flap dampening is not working per VRF and is working only
   for IPv4 unicast and multicast.

.. _bgp-med:

Multi-Exit Discriminator
------------------------

The BGP :abbr:`MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)` attribute has properties which
can cause subtle convergence problems in BGP. These properties and problems
have proven to be hard to understand, at least historically, and may still not
be widely understood. The following attempts to collect together and present
what is known about MED, to help operators and FRR users in designing and
configuring their networks.

The BGP :abbr:`MED` attribute is intended to allow one AS to indicate its
preferences for its ingress points to another AS. The MED attribute will not be
propagated on to another AS by the receiving AS - it is 'non-transitive' in the
BGP sense.

E.g., if AS X and AS Y have 2 different BGP peering points, then AS X might set
a MED of 100 on routes advertised at one and a MED of 200 at the other. When AS
Y selects between otherwise equal routes to or via AS X, AS Y should prefer to
take the path via the lower MED peering of 100 with AS X. Setting the MED
allows an AS to influence the routing taken to it within another, neighbouring
AS.

In this use of MED it is not really meaningful to compare the MED value on
routes where the next AS on the paths differs. E.g., if AS Y also had a route
for some destination via AS Z in addition to the routes from AS X, and AS Z had
also set a MED, it wouldn't make sense for AS Y to compare AS Z's MED values to
those of AS X. The MED values have been set by different administrators, with
different frames of reference.

The default behaviour of BGP therefore is to not compare MED values across
routes received from different neighbouring ASes. In FRR this is done by
comparing the neighbouring, left-most AS in the received AS_PATHs of the routes
and only comparing MED if those are the same.

Unfortunately, this behaviour of MED, of sometimes being compared across routes
and sometimes not, depending on the properties of those other routes, means MED
can cause the order of preference over all the routes to be undefined. That is,
given routes A, B, and C, if A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C, then
a well-defined order should mean the preference is transitive (in the sense of
orders [#med-transitivity-rant]_) and that A would be preferred to C.

However, when MED is involved this need not be the case. With MED it is
possible that C is actually preferred over A. So A is preferred to B, B is
preferred to C, but C is preferred to A. This can be true even where BGP
defines a deterministic 'most preferred' route out of the full set of A,B,C.
With MED, for any given set of routes there may be a deterministically
preferred route, but there need not be any way to arrange them into any order
of preference. With unmodified MED, the order of preference of routes literally
becomes undefined.

That MED can induce non-transitive preferences over routes can cause issues.
Firstly, it may be perceived to cause routing table churn locally at speakers;
secondly, and more seriously, it may cause routing instability in iBGP
topologies, where sets of speakers continually oscillate between different
paths.

The first issue arises from how speakers often implement routing decisions.
Though BGP defines a selection process that will deterministically select the
same route as best at any given speaker, even with MED, that process requires
evaluating all routes together. For performance and ease of implementation
reasons, many implementations evaluate route preferences in a pair-wise fashion
instead. Given there is no well-defined order when MED is involved, the best
route that will be chosen becomes subject to implementation details, such as
the order the routes are stored in. That may be (locally) non-deterministic,
e.g.: it may be the order the routes were received in.

This indeterminism may be considered undesirable, though it need not cause
problems. It may mean additional routing churn is perceived, as sometimes more
updates may be produced than at other times in reaction to some event .

This first issue can be fixed with a more deterministic route selection that
ensures routes are ordered by the neighbouring AS during selection.
:clicmd:`bgp deterministic-med`. This may reduce the number of updates as routes
are received, and may in some cases reduce routing churn. Though, it could
equally deterministically produce the largest possible set of updates in
response to the most common sequence of received updates.

A deterministic order of evaluation tends to imply an additional overhead of
sorting over any set of n routes to a destination. The implementation of
deterministic MED in FRR scales significantly worse than most sorting
algorithms at present, with the number of paths to a given destination.  That
number is often low enough to not cause any issues, but where there are many
paths, the deterministic comparison may quickly become increasingly expensive
in terms of CPU.

Deterministic local evaluation can *not* fix the second, more major, issue of
MED however. Which is that the non-transitive preference of routes MED can
cause may lead to routing instability or oscillation across multiple speakers
in iBGP topologies. This can occur with full-mesh iBGP, but is particularly
problematic in non-full-mesh iBGP topologies that further reduce the routing
information known to each speaker. This has primarily been documented with iBGP
:ref:`route-reflection <bgp-route-reflector>` topologies. However, any
route-hiding technologies potentially could also exacerbate oscillation with MED.

This second issue occurs where speakers each have only a subset of routes, and
there are cycles in the preferences between different combinations of routes -
as the undefined order of preference of MED allows - and the routes are
distributed in a way that causes the BGP speakers to 'chase' those cycles. This
can occur even if all speakers use a deterministic order of evaluation in route
selection.

E.g., speaker 4 in AS A might receive a route from speaker 2 in AS X, and from
speaker 3 in AS Y; while speaker 5 in AS A might receive that route from
speaker 1 in AS Y. AS Y might set a MED of 200 at speaker 1, and 100 at speaker
3. I.e, using ASN:ID:MED to label the speakers:

::

   .
             /---------------\\
   X:2------|--A:4-------A:5--|-Y:1:200
               Y:3:100--|-/   |
             \\---------------/



Assuming all other metrics are equal (AS_PATH, ORIGIN, 0 IGP costs), then based
on the RFC4271 decision process speaker 4 will choose X:2 over Y:3:100, based
on the lower ID of 2. Speaker 4 advertises X:2 to speaker 5.  Speaker 5 will
continue to prefer Y:1:200 based on the ID, and advertise this to speaker 4.
Speaker 4 will now have the full set of routes, and the Y:1:200 it receives
from 5 will beat X:2, but when speaker 4 compares Y:1:200 to Y:3:100 the MED
check now becomes active as the ASes match, and now Y:3:100 is preferred.
Speaker 4 therefore now advertises Y:3:100 to 5, which will also agrees that
Y:3:100 is preferred to Y:1:200, and so withdraws the latter route from 4.
Speaker 4 now has only X:2 and Y:3:100, and X:2 beats Y:3:100, and so speaker 4
implicitly updates its route to speaker 5 to X:2. Speaker 5 sees that Y:1:200
beats X:2 based on the ID, and advertises Y:1:200 to speaker 4, and the cycle
continues.

The root cause is the lack of a clear order of preference caused by how MED
sometimes is and sometimes is not compared, leading to this cycle in the
preferences between the routes:

::

   .
    /---> X:2 ---beats---> Y:3:100 --\\
   |                                   |
   |                                   |
    \\---beats--- Y:1:200 <---beats---/



This particular type of oscillation in full-mesh iBGP topologies can  be
avoided by speakers preferring already selected, external routes rather than
choosing to update to new a route based on a post-MED metric (e.g.  router-ID),
at the cost of a non-deterministic selection process. FRR implements this, as
do many other implementations, so long as it is not overridden by setting
:clicmd:`bgp bestpath compare-routerid`, and see also
:ref:`bgp-route-selection`.

However, more complex and insidious cycles of oscillation are possible with
iBGP route-reflection, which are not so easily avoided. These have been
documented in various places. See, e.g.:

- [bgp-route-osci-cond]_
- [stable-flexible-ibgp]_
- [ibgp-correctness]_

for concrete examples and further references.

There is as of this writing *no* known way to use MED for its original purpose;
*and* reduce routing information in iBGP topologies; *and* be sure to avoid the
instability problems of MED due the non-transitive routing preferences it can
induce; in general on arbitrary networks.

There may be iBGP topology specific ways to reduce the instability risks, even
while using MED, e.g.: by constraining the reflection topology and by tuning
IGP costs between route-reflector clusters, see :rfc:`3345` for details.  In the
near future, the Add-Path extension to BGP may also solve MED oscillation while
still allowing MED to be used as intended, by distributing "best-paths per
neighbour AS". This would be at the cost of distributing at least as many
routes to all speakers as a full-mesh iBGP would, if not more, while also
imposing similar CPU overheads as the "Deterministic MED" feature at each
Add-Path reflector.

More generally, the instability problems that MED can introduce on more
complex, non-full-mesh, iBGP topologies may be avoided either by:

- Setting :clicmd:`bgp always-compare-med`, however this allows MED to be compared
  across values set by different neighbour ASes, which may not produce
  coherent desirable results, of itself.
- Effectively ignoring MED by setting MED to the same value (e.g.: 0) using
  :clicmd:`set metric METRIC` on all received routes, in combination with
  setting :clicmd:`bgp always-compare-med` on all speakers. This is the simplest
  and most performant way to avoid MED oscillation issues, where an AS is happy
  not to allow neighbours to inject this problematic metric.

As MED is evaluated after the AS_PATH length check, another possible use for
MED is for intra-AS steering of routes with equal AS_PATH length, as an
extension of the last case above. As MED is evaluated before IGP metric, this
can allow cold-potato routing to be implemented to send traffic to preferred
hand-offs with neighbours, rather than the closest hand-off according to the
IGP metric.

Note that even if action is taken to address the MED non-transitivity issues,
other oscillations may still be possible. E.g., on IGP cost if iBGP and IGP
topologies are at cross-purposes with each other - see the Flavel and Roughan
paper above for an example. Hence the guideline that the iBGP topology should
follow the IGP topology.

.. index:: bgp deterministic-med
.. clicmd:: bgp deterministic-med

   Carry out route-selection in way that produces deterministic answers
   locally, even in the face of MED and the lack of a well-defined order of
   preference it can induce on routes. Without this option the preferred route
   with MED may be determined largely by the order that routes were received
   in.

   Setting this option will have a performance cost that may be noticeable when
   there are many routes for each destination. Currently in FRR it is
   implemented in a way that scales poorly as the number of routes per
   destination increases.

   The default is that this option is not set.

Note that there are other sources of indeterminism in the route selection
process, specifically, the preference for older and already selected routes
from eBGP peers, :ref:`bgp-route-selection`.

.. index:: bgp always-compare-med
.. clicmd:: bgp always-compare-med

   Always compare the MED on routes, even when they were received from
   different neighbouring ASes. Setting this option makes the order of
   preference of routes more defined, and should eliminate MED induced
   oscillations.

   If using this option, it may also be desirable to use
   :clicmd:`set metric METRIC` to set MED to 0 on routes received from external
   neighbours.

   This option can be used, together with :clicmd:`set metric METRIC` to use
   MED as an intra-AS metric to steer equal-length AS_PATH routes to, e.g.,
   desired exit points.


.. _bgp-graceful-restart:

Graceful Restart
----------------

BGP graceful restart functionality as defined in
`RFC-4724 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4724/>`_ defines the mechanisms that
allows BGP speaker to continue to forward data packets along known routes
while the routing protocol information is being restored.


Usually, when BGP on a router restarts, all the BGP peers detect that the
session went down and then came up. This "down/up" transition results in a
"routing flap" and causes BGP route re-computation, generation of BGP routing
updates, and unnecessary churn to the forwarding tables.

The following functionality is provided by graceful restart:

1. The feature allows the restarting router to indicate to the helping peer the
   routes it can preserve in its forwarding plane during control plane restart
   by sending graceful restart capability in the OPEN message sent during
   session establishment.
2. The feature allows helping router to advertise to all other peers the routes
   received from the restarting router which are preserved in the forwarding
   plane of the restarting router during control plane restart.


::



 (R1)-----------------------------------------------------------------(R2)

 1. BGP Graceful Restart Capability exchanged between R1 & R2.

 <--------------------------------------------------------------------->

 2. Kill BGP Process at R1.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------->

 3. R2 Detects the above BGP Restart & verifies BGP Restarting
   Capability of R1.

 4. Start BGP Process at R1.

 5. Re-establish the BGP session between R1 & R2.

 <--------------------------------------------------------------------->

 6. R2 Send initial route updates, followed by End-Of-Rib.

 <----------------------------------------------------------------------

 7. R1 was waiting for End-Of-Rib from R2 & which has been received
   now.

 8. R1 now runs BGP Best-Path algorithm. Send Initial BGP  Update,
   followed by End-Of Rib

 <--------------------------------------------------------------------->


.. _bgp-end-of-rib-message:

End-of-RIB (EOR) message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An UPDATE message with no reachable Network Layer Reachability  Information
(NLRI) and empty withdrawn NLRI is specified as the End-of-RIB marker that can
be used by a BGP speaker to indicate to its peer the completion of the initial
routing update after the session is established.

For the IPv4 unicast address family, the End-of-RIB marker is an UPDATE message
with the minimum length. For any other address family, it is an UPDATE message
that contains only the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute with no withdrawn routes for
that <AFI, SAFI>.

Although the End-of-RIB marker is specified for the purpose of BGP graceful
restart, it is noted that the generation of such a marker upon completion of
the initial update would be useful for routing convergence in general, and thus
the practice is recommended.

.. _bgp-route-selection-deferral-timer:

Route Selection Deferral Timer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specifies the time the restarting router defers the route selection process
after restart.

Restarting Router : The usage of route election deferral timer is specified
in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4724#section-4.1

Once the session between the Restarting Speaker and the Receiving Speaker is
re-established, the Restarting Speaker will receive and process BGP messages
from its peers.

However, it MUST defer route selection for an address family until it either.

1. Receives the End-of-RIB marker from all its peers (excluding the ones with
   the "Restart State" bit set in the received capability and excluding the ones
   that do not advertise the graceful restart capability).
2. The Selection_Deferral_Timer timeout.

.. index:: bgp graceful-restart select-defer-time (0-3600)
.. clicmd:: bgp graceful-restart select-defer-time (0-3600)

   This is command, will set deferral time to value specified.


.. index:: bgp graceful-restart rib-stale-time (1-3600)
.. clicmd:: bgp graceful-restart rib-stale-time (1-3600)

   This is command, will set the time for which stale routes are kept in RIB.

.. _bgp-per-peer-graceful-restart:

BGP Per Peer Graceful Restart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ability to enable and disable graceful restart, helper and no GR at all mode
functionality at peer level.

So bgp graceful restart can be enabled at modes  global BGP level or at per
peer level. There are two FSM, one for BGP GR global mode and other for peer
per GR.

Default global mode is helper and default peer per mode is inherit from global.
If per peer mode is configured, the GR mode of this particular peer will
override the global mode.

.. _bgp-GR-global-mode-cmd:

BGP GR Global Mode Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: bgp graceful-restart
.. clicmd:: bgp graceful-restart

   This command will enable BGP graceful restart ifunctionality at the global
   level.

.. index:: bgp graceful-restart disable
.. clicmd:: bgp graceful-restart disable

   This command will disable both the functionality graceful restart and helper
   mode.


.. _bgp-GR-peer-mode-cmd:

BGP GR Peer Mode Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart
.. clicmd:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart

   This command will enable BGP graceful restart ifunctionality at the peer
   level.

.. index:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart-helper
.. clicmd:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart-helper

   This command will enable BGP graceful restart helper only functionality
   at the peer level.

.. index:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart-disable
.. clicmd:: neighbor A.B.C.D graceful-restart-disable

   This command will disable the entire BGP graceful restart functionality
   at the peer level.


.. _bgp-network:

Networks
--------

.. index:: network A.B.C.D/M
.. clicmd:: network A.B.C.D/M

   This command adds the announcement network.

   .. code-block:: frr

      router bgp 1
       address-family ipv4 unicast
        network 10.0.0.0/8
       exit-address-family

   This configuration example says that network 10.0.0.0/8 will be
   announced to all neighbors. Some vendors' routers don't advertise
   routes if they aren't present in their IGP routing tables; `bgpd`
   doesn't care about IGP routes when announcing its routes.

.. index:: no network A.B.C.D/M
.. clicmd:: no network A.B.C.D/M

.. index:: [no] bgp network import-check
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp network import-check

   This configuration modifies the behavior of the network statement.
   If you have this configured the underlying network must exist in
   the rib.  If you have the [no] form configured then BGP will not
   check for the networks existence in the rib.  For versions 7.3 and
   before frr defaults for datacenter were the network must exist,
   traditional did not check for existence.  For versions 7.4 and beyond
   both traditional and datacenter the network must exist.

.. _bgp-route-aggregation:

Route Aggregation
-----------------

.. _bgp-route-aggregation-ipv4:

Route Aggregation-IPv4 Address Family
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: aggregate-address A.B.C.D/M
.. clicmd:: aggregate-address A.B.C.D/M

   This command specifies an aggregate address.

.. index:: aggregate-address A.B.C.D/M route-map NAME

   This command specifies an aggregate address. Aggregated routes will
   not be announced.

.. index:: no aggregate-address A.B.C.D/M
.. clicmd:: no aggregate-address A.B.C.D/M

   This command removes an aggregate address.


   This configuration example setup the aggregate-address under
   ipv4 address-family.

   .. code-block:: frr

      router bgp 1
       address-family ipv4 unicast
        aggregate-address 10.0.0.0/8
        aggregate-address 20.0.0.0/8 as-set

.. _bgp-route-aggregation-ipv6:

Route Aggregation-IPv6 Address Family
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M
.. clicmd:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M

   This command specifies an aggregate address.

.. index:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M route-map NAME
.. clicmd:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M route-map NAME

   Apply a route-map for an aggregated prefix.

.. index:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M origin <egp|igp|incomplete>

   AS set.

.. index:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M summary-only
.. clicmd:: aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M summary-only

   This command specifies an aggregate address. Aggregated routes will
   not be announced.

.. index:: no aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M
.. clicmd:: no aggregate-address X:X::X:X/M

   This command removes an aggregate address.

.. _bgp-redistribute-to-bgp:

Redistribution
--------------

.. index:: redistribute kernel
.. clicmd:: redistribute kernel

   Redistribute kernel route to BGP process.

.. index:: redistribute static
.. clicmd:: redistribute static

   Redistribute static route to BGP process.

.. index:: redistribute connected
.. clicmd:: redistribute connected

   Redistribute connected route to BGP process.

.. index:: redistribute rip
.. clicmd:: redistribute rip

   Redistribute RIP route to BGP process.

.. index:: redistribute vnc-direct
.. clicmd:: redistribute vnc-direct

   Redistribute VNC direct (not via zebra) routes to BGP process.

.. index:: update-delay MAX-DELAY
.. clicmd:: update-delay MAX-DELAY

.. index:: update-delay MAX-DELAY ESTABLISH-WAIT
.. clicmd:: update-delay MAX-DELAY ESTABLISH-WAIT

   This feature is used to enable read-only mode on BGP process restart or when
   BGP process is cleared using 'clear ip bgp \*'. When applicable, read-only
   mode would begin as soon as the first peer reaches Established status and a
   timer for max-delay seconds is started.

   During this mode BGP doesn't run any best-path or generate any updates to its
   peers. This mode continues until:

   1. All the configured peers, except the shutdown peers, have sent explicit EOR
      (End-Of-RIB) or an implicit-EOR. The first keep-alive after BGP has reached
      Established is considered an implicit-EOR.
      If the establish-wait optional value is given, then BGP will wait for
      peers to reach established from the beginning of the update-delay till the
      establish-wait period is over, i.e. the minimum set of established peers for
      which EOR is expected would be peers established during the establish-wait
      window, not necessarily all the configured neighbors.
   2. max-delay period is over.

   On hitting any of the above two conditions, BGP resumes the decision process
   and generates updates to its peers.

   Default max-delay is 0, i.e. the feature is off by default.

.. index:: table-map ROUTE-MAP-NAME
.. clicmd:: table-map ROUTE-MAP-NAME

   This feature is used to apply a route-map on route updates from BGP to
   Zebra.  All the applicable match operations are allowed, such as match on
   prefix, next-hop, communities, etc. Set operations for this attach-point are
   limited to metric and next-hop only. Any operation of this feature does not
   affect BGPs internal RIB.

   Supported for ipv4 and ipv6 address families. It works on multi-paths as
   well, however, metric setting is based on the best-path only.

.. _bgp-peers:

Peers
-----

.. _bgp-defining-peers:

Defining Peers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: neighbor PEER remote-as ASN
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER remote-as ASN

   Creates a new neighbor whose remote-as is ASN. PEER can be an IPv4 address
   or an IPv6 address or an interface to use for the connection.

   .. code-block:: frr

       router bgp 1
        neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2

   In this case my router, in AS-1, is trying to peer with AS-2 at 10.0.0.1.

   This command must be the first command used when configuring a neighbor.  If
   the remote-as is not specified, *bgpd* will complain like this: ::

      can't find neighbor 10.0.0.1

.. index:: neighbor PEER remote-as internal
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER remote-as internal

   Create a peer as you would when you specify an ASN, except that if the
   peers ASN is different than mine as specified under the :clicmd:`router bgp ASN`
   command the connection will be denied.

.. index:: neighbor PEER remote-as external
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER remote-as external

   Create a peer as you would when you specify an ASN, except that if the
   peers ASN is the same as mine as specified under the :clicmd:`router bgp ASN`
   command the connection will be denied.

.. index:: [no] bgp listen range <A.B.C.D/M|X:X::X:X/M> peer-group PGNAME
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp listen range <A.B.C.D/M|X:X::X:X/M> peer-group PGNAME

   Accept connections from any peers in the specified prefix. Configuration
   from the specified peer-group is used to configure these peers.

.. note::

   When using BGP listen ranges, if the associated peer group has TCP MD5
   authentication configured, your kernel must support this on prefixes. On
   Linux, this support was added in kernel version 4.14. If your kernel does
   not support this feature you will get a warning in the log file, and the
   listen range will only accept connections from peers without MD5 configured.

   Additionally, we have observed that when using this option at scale (several
   hundred peers) the kernel may hit its option memory limit. In this situation
   you will see error messages like:

   ``bgpd: sockopt_tcp_signature: setsockopt(23): Cannot allocate memory``

   In this case you need to increase the value of the sysctl
   ``net.core.optmem_max`` to allow the kernel to allocate the necessary option
   memory.

.. _bgp-configuring-peers:

Configuring Peers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER shutdown
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER shutdown

   Shutdown the peer. We can delete the neighbor's configuration by
   ``no neighbor PEER remote-as ASN`` but all configuration of the neighbor
   will be deleted. When you want to preserve the configuration, but want to
   drop the BGP peer, use this syntax.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER disable-connected-check
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER disable-connected-check

   Allow peerings between directly connected eBGP peers using loopback
   addresses.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER ebgp-multihop
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER ebgp-multihop

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER description ...
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER description ...

   Set description of the peer.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER version VERSION
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER version VERSION

   Set up the neighbor's BGP version. `version` can be `4`, `4+` or `4-`. BGP
   version `4` is the default value used for BGP peering. BGP version `4+`
   means that the neighbor supports Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4. BGP
   version `4-` is similar but the neighbor speaks the old Internet-Draft
   revision 00's Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4. Some routing software is
   still using this version.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER interface IFNAME
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER interface IFNAME

   When you connect to a BGP peer over an IPv6 link-local address, you have to
   specify the IFNAME of the interface used for the connection. To specify
   IPv4 session addresses, see the ``neighbor PEER update-source`` command
   below.

   This command is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Its use
   should be avoided.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER next-hop-self [all]
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER next-hop-self [all]

   This command specifies an announced route's nexthop as being equivalent to
   the address of the bgp router if it is learned via eBGP.  If the optional
   keyword `all` is specified the modification is done also for routes learned
   via iBGP.

.. index:: neighbor PEER attribute-unchanged [{as-path|next-hop|med}]
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER attribute-unchanged [{as-path|next-hop|med}]

   This command specifies attributes to be left unchanged for advertisements
   sent to a peer. Use this to leave the next-hop unchanged in ipv6
   configurations, as the route-map directive to leave the next-hop unchanged
   is only available for ipv4.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER update-source <IFNAME|ADDRESS>
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER update-source <IFNAME|ADDRESS>

   Specify the IPv4 source address to use for the :abbr:`BGP` session to this
   neighbour, may be specified as either an IPv4 address directly or as an
   interface name (in which case the *zebra* daemon MUST be running in order
   for *bgpd* to be able to retrieve interface state).

   .. code-block:: frr

      router bgp 64555
       neighbor foo update-source 192.168.0.1
       neighbor bar update-source lo0


.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER default-originate
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER default-originate

   *bgpd*'s default is to not announce the default route (0.0.0.0/0) even if it
   is in routing table. When you want to announce default routes to the peer,
   use this command.

.. index:: neighbor PEER port PORT
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER port PORT

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER password PASSWORD
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER password PASSWORD

   Set a MD5 password to be used with the tcp socket that is being used
   to connect to the remote peer.  Please note if you are using this
   command with a large number of peers on linux you should consider
   modifying the `net.core.optmem_max` sysctl to a larger value to
   avoid out of memory errors from the linux kernel.

.. index:: neighbor PEER send-community
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER send-community

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER weight WEIGHT
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER weight WEIGHT

   This command specifies a default `weight` value for the neighbor's routes.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER maximum-prefix NUMBER
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER maximum-prefix NUMBER

   Sets a maximum number of prefixes we can receive from a given peer. If this
   number is exceeded, the BGP session will be destroyed.

   In practice, it is generally preferable to use a prefix-list to limit what
   prefixes are received from the peer instead of using this knob. Tearing down
   the BGP session when a limit is exceeded is far more destructive than merely
   rejecting undesired prefixes. The prefix-list method is also much more
   granular and offers much smarter matching criterion than number of received
   prefixes, making it more suited to implementing policy.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER maximum-prefix-out NUMBER
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER maximum-prefix-out NUMBER

   Sets a maximum number of prefixes we can send to a given peer.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER local-as AS-NUMBER [no-prepend] [replace-as]
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER local-as AS-NUMBER [no-prepend] [replace-as]

   Specify an alternate AS for this BGP process when interacting with the
   specified peer. With no modifiers, the specified local-as is prepended to
   the received AS_PATH when receiving routing updates from the peer, and
   prepended to the outgoing AS_PATH (after the process local AS) when
   transmitting local routes to the peer.

   If the no-prepend attribute is specified, then the supplied local-as is not
   prepended to the received AS_PATH.

   If the replace-as attribute is specified, then only the supplied local-as is
   prepended to the AS_PATH when transmitting local-route updates to this peer.

   Note that replace-as can only be specified if no-prepend is.

   This command is only allowed for eBGP peers.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER ttl-security hops NUMBER
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER ttl-security hops NUMBER

   This command enforces Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM), as
   specified in RFC 5082. With this command, only neighbors that are the
   specified number of hops away will be allowed to become neighbors. This
   command is mutually exclusive with *ebgp-multihop*.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER capability extended-nexthop
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER capability extended-nexthop

   Allow bgp to negotiate the extended-nexthop capability with it's peer.
   If you are peering over a v6 LL address then this capability is turned
   on automatically.  If you are peering over a v6 Global Address then
   turning on this command will allow BGP to install v4 routes with
   v6 nexthops if you do not have v4 configured on interfaces.

.. index:: [no] bgp fast-external-failover
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp fast-external-failover

   This command causes bgp to not take down ebgp peers immediately
   when a link flaps.  `bgp fast-external-failover` is the default
   and will not be displayed as part of a `show run`.  The no form
   of the command turns off this ability.

.. index:: [no] bgp default ipv4-unicast
.. clicmd:: [no] bgp default ipv4-unicast

   This command allows the user to specify that v4 peering is turned
   on by default or not.  This command defaults to on and is not displayed.
   The `no bgp default ipv4-unicast` form of the command is displayed.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER advertisement-interval (0-600)
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER advertisement-interval (0-600)

   Setup the minimum route advertisement interval(mrai) for the
   peer in question.  This number is between 0 and 600 seconds,
   with the default advertisement interval being 0.

.. _bgp-peer-filtering:

Peer Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: neighbor PEER distribute-list NAME [in|out]
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER distribute-list NAME [in|out]

   This command specifies a distribute-list for the peer. `direct` is
   ``in`` or ``out``.

.. index:: neighbor PEER prefix-list NAME [in|out]
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER prefix-list NAME [in|out]

.. index:: neighbor PEER filter-list NAME [in|out]
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER filter-list NAME [in|out]

.. index:: neighbor PEER route-map NAME [in|out]
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER route-map NAME [in|out]

   Apply a route-map on the neighbor. `direct` must be `in` or `out`.

.. index:: bgp route-reflector allow-outbound-policy
.. clicmd:: bgp route-reflector allow-outbound-policy

   By default, attribute modification via route-map policy out is not reflected
   on reflected routes. This option allows the modifications to be reflected as
   well. Once enabled, it affects all reflected routes.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER sender-as-path-loop-detection
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER sender-as-path-loop-detection

   Enable the detection of sender side AS path loops and filter the
   bad routes before they are sent.

   This setting is disabled by default.

.. _bgp-peer-group:

Peer Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^

Peer groups are used to help improve scaling by generating the same
update information to all members of a peer group. Note that this means
that the routes generated by a member of a peer group will be sent back
to that originating peer with the originator identifier attribute set to
indicated the originating peer.  All peers not associated with a
specific peer group are treated as belonging to a default peer group,
and will share updates.

.. index:: neighbor WORD peer-group
.. clicmd:: neighbor WORD peer-group

   This command defines a new peer group.

.. index:: neighbor PEER peer-group PGNAME
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER peer-group PGNAME

   This command bind specific peer to peer group WORD.

.. index:: neighbor PEER solo
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER solo

   This command is used to indicate that routes advertised by the peer
   should not be reflected back to the peer.  This command only is only
   meaningful when there is a single peer defined in the peer-group.

Capability Negotiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER strict-capability-match

.. index:: no neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
.. clicmd:: no neighbor PEER strict-capability-match

   Strictly compares remote capabilities and local capabilities. If
   capabilities are different, send Unsupported Capability error then reset
   connection.

   You may want to disable sending Capability Negotiation OPEN message optional
   parameter to the peer when remote peer does not implement Capability
   Negotiation. Please use *dont-capability-negotiate* command to disable the
   feature.

.. index:: [no] neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate
.. clicmd:: [no] neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate

   Suppress sending Capability Negotiation as OPEN message optional parameter
   to the peer. This command only affects the peer is configured other than
   IPv4 unicast configuration.

   When remote peer does not have capability negotiation feature, remote peer
   will not send any capabilities at all. In that case, bgp configures the peer
   with configured capabilities.

   You may prefer locally configured capabilities more than the negotiated
   capabilities even though remote peer sends capabilities. If the peer is
   configured by *override-capability*, *bgpd* ignores received capabilities
   then override negotiated capabilities with configured values.

   Additionally the operator should be reminded that this feature fundamentally
   disables the ability to use widely deployed BGP features.  BGP unnumbered,
   hostname support, AS4, Addpath, Route Refresh, ORF, Dynamic Capabilities,
   and graceful restart.

.. index:: neighbor PEER override-capability
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER override-capability

.. index:: no neighbor PEER override-capability
.. clicmd:: no neighbor PEER override-capability

   removes this match from the route-map.

.. index:: [no] set as-path prepend AS-PATH
.. clicmd:: [no] set as-path prepend AS-PATH

   Prepend the given string of AS numbers to the AS_PATH of the BGP path's NLRI.
   The no form of this command removes this set operation from the route-map.

.. index:: [no] set as-path prepend last-as NUM
.. clicmd:: [no] set as-path prepend last-as NUM

   Prepend the existing last AS number (the leftmost ASN) to the AS_PATH.
   The no form of this command removes this set operation from the route-map.

.. _bgp-communities-attribute:

Communities Attribute
---------------------

The BGP communities attribute is widely used for implementing policy routing.
Network operators can manipulate BGP communities attribute based on their
network policy. BGP communities attribute is defined in :rfc:`1997` and
:rfc:`1998`. It is an optional transitive attribute, therefore local policy can
travel through different autonomous system.

The communities attribute is a set of communities values. Each community value
is 4 octet long. The following format is used to define the community value.

``AS:VAL``
   This format represents 4 octet communities value. ``AS`` is high order 2
   octet in digit format. ``VAL`` is low order 2 octet in digit format. This
   format is useful to define AS oriented policy value. For example,
   ``7675:80`` can be used when AS 7675 wants to pass local policy value 80 to
   neighboring peer.

``internet``
   ``internet`` represents well-known communities value 0.

``graceful-shutdown``
   ``graceful-shutdown`` represents well-known communities value
   ``GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN`` ``0xFFFF0000`` ``65535:0``. :rfc:`8326` implements
   the purpose Graceful BGP Session Shutdown to reduce the amount of
   lost traffic when taking BGP sessions down for maintenance. The use
   of the community needs to be supported from your peers side to
   actually have any effect.

``accept-own``
   ``accept-own`` represents well-known communities value ``ACCEPT_OWN``
   ``0xFFFF0001`` ``65535:1``. :rfc:`7611` implements a way to signal
   to a router to accept routes with a local nexthop address. This
   can be the case when doing policing and having traffic having a
   nexthop located in another VRF but still local interface to the
   router. It is recommended to read the RFC for full details.

``route-filter-translated-v4``
   ``route-filter-translated-v4`` represents well-known communities value
   ``ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v4`` ``0xFFFF0002`` ``65535:2``.

``route-filter-v4``
   ``route-filter-v4`` represents well-known communities value
   ``ROUTE_FILTER_v4`` ``0xFFFF0003`` ``65535:3``.

``route-filter-translated-v6``
   ``route-filter-translated-v6`` represents well-known communities value
   ``ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v6`` ``0xFFFF0004`` ``65535:4``.

``route-filter-v6``
   ``route-filter-v6`` represents well-known communities value
   ``ROUTE_FILTER_v6`` ``0xFFFF0005`` ``65535:5``.

``llgr-stale``
   ``llgr-stale`` represents well-known communities value ``LLGR_STALE``
   ``0xFFFF0006`` ``65535:6``.
   Assigned and intended only for use with routers supporting the
   Long-lived Graceful Restart Capability  as described in
   [Draft-IETF-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence]_.
   Routers receiving routes with this community may (depending on
   implementation) choose allow to reject or modify routes on the
   presence or absence of this community.

``no-llgr``
   ``no-llgr`` represents well-known communities value ``NO_LLGR``
   ``0xFFFF0007`` ``65535:7``.
   Assigned and intended only for use with routers supporting the
   Long-lived Graceful Restart Capability  as described in
   [Draft-IETF-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence]_.
   Routers receiving routes with this community may (depending on
   implementation) choose allow to reject or modify routes on the
   presence or absence of this community.

``accept-own-nexthop``
   ``accept-own-nexthop`` represents well-known communities value
   ``accept-own-nexthop`` ``0xFFFF0008`` ``65535:8``.
   [Draft-IETF-agrewal-idr-accept-own-nexthop]_ describes
   how to tag and label VPN routes to be able to send traffic between VRFs
   via an internal layer 2 domain on the same PE device. Refer to
   [Draft-IETF-agrewal-idr-accept-own-nexthop]_ for full details.

``blackhole``
   ``blackhole`` represents well-known communities value ``BLACKHOLE``
   ``0xFFFF029A`` ``65535:666``. :rfc:`7999` documents sending prefixes to
   EBGP peers and upstream for the purpose of blackholing traffic.
   Prefixes tagged with the this community should normally not be
   re-advertised from neighbors of the originating network. It is
   recommended upon receiving prefixes tagged with this community to
   add ``NO_EXPORT`` and ``NO_ADVERTISE``.

``no-export``
   ``no-export`` represents well-known communities value ``NO_EXPORT``
   ``0xFFFFFF01``. All routes carry this value must not be advertised to
   outside a BGP confederation boundary. If neighboring BGP peer is part of BGP
   confederation, the peer is considered as inside a BGP confederation
   boundary, so the route will be announced to the peer.

``no-advertise``
   ``no-advertise`` represents well-known communities value ``NO_ADVERTISE``
   ``0xFFFFFF02``. All routes carry this value must not be advertise to other
   BGP peers.

``local-AS``
   ``local-AS`` represents well-known communities value ``NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED``
   ``0xFFFFFF03``. All routes carry this value must not be advertised to
   external BGP peers. Even if the neighboring router is part of confederation,
   it is considered as external BGP peer, so the route will not be announced to
   the peer.

``no-peer``
   ``no-peer`` represents well-known communities value ``NOPEER``
   ``0xFFFFFF04``  ``65535:65284``. :rfc:`3765` is used to communicate to
   another network how the originating network want the prefix propagated.

When the communities attribute is received duplicate community values in the
attribute are ignored and value is sorted in numerical order.

.. _bgp-community-lists:

Community Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Community lists are user defined lists of community attribute values. These
lists can be used for matching or manipulating the communities attribute in
UPDATE messages.

There are two types of community list:

standard
   This type accepts an explicit value for the attribute.

expanded
   This type accepts a regular expression. Because the regex must be
   interpreted on each use expanded community lists are slower than standard
   lists.

.. index:: bgp community-list standard NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp community-list standard NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY

   This command defines a new standard community list. ``COMMUNITY`` is
   communities value. The ``COMMUNITY`` is compiled into community structure.
   We can define multiple community list under same name. In that case match
   will happen user defined order. Once the community list matches to
   communities attribute in BGP updates it return permit or deny by the
   community list definition. When there is no matched entry, deny will be
   returned. When ``COMMUNITY`` is empty it matches to any routes.

.. index:: bgp community-list expanded NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp community-list expanded NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY

   This command defines a new expanded community list. ``COMMUNITY`` is a
   string expression of communities attribute. ``COMMUNITY`` can be a regular
   expression (:ref:`bgp-regular-expressions`) to match the communities
   attribute in BGP updates. The expanded community is only used to filter,
   not `set` actions.

.. deprecated:: 5.0
   It is recommended to use the more explicit versions of this command.

.. index:: bgp community-list NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp community-list NAME permit|deny COMMUNITY

   When the community list type is not specified, the community list type is
   automatically detected. If ``COMMUNITY`` can be compiled into communities
   attribute, the community list is defined as a standard community list.
   Otherwise it is defined as an expanded community list. This feature is left
   for backward compatibility. Use of this feature is not recommended.


.. index:: no bgp community-list [standard|expanded] NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp community-list [standard|expanded] NAME

   Deletes the community list specified by ``NAME``. All community lists share
   the same namespace, so it's not necessary to specify ``standard`` or
   ``expanded``; these modifiers are purely aesthetic.

.. index:: show bgp community-list [NAME detail]
.. clicmd:: show bgp community-list [NAME detail]

   Displays community list information. When ``NAME`` is specified the
   specified community list's information is shown.

   ::

       # show bgp community-list
       Named Community standard list CLIST
       permit 7675:80 7675:100 no-export
       deny internet
         Named Community expanded list EXPAND
       permit :

         # show bgp community-list CLIST detail
         Named Community standard list CLIST
       permit 7675:80 7675:100 no-export
       deny internet


.. _bgp-numbered-community-lists:

Numbered Community Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When number is used for BGP community list name, the number has
special meanings. Community list number in the range from 1 and 99 is
standard community list. Community list number in the range from 100
to 199 is expanded community list. These community lists are called
as numbered community lists. On the other hand normal community lists
is called as named community lists.

.. index:: bgp community-list (1-99) permit|deny COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp community-list (1-99) permit|deny COMMUNITY

   This command defines a new community list. The argument to (1-99) defines
   the list identifier.

.. index:: bgp community-list (100-199) permit|deny COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp community-list (100-199) permit|deny COMMUNITY

   This command defines a new expanded community list. The argument to
   (100-199) defines the list identifier.

.. _bgp-using-communities-in-route-map:

Using Communities in Route Maps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In :ref:`route-map` we can match on or set the BGP communities attribute. Using
this feature network operator can implement their network policy based on BGP
communities attribute.

The following commands can be used in route maps:

.. index:: match community WORD exact-match [exact-match]
.. clicmd:: match community WORD exact-match [exact-match]

   This command perform match to BGP updates using community list WORD. When
   the one of BGP communities value match to the one of communities value in
   community list, it is match. When `exact-match` keyword is specified, match
   happen only when BGP updates have completely same communities value
   specified in the community list.

.. index:: set community <none|COMMUNITY> additive
.. clicmd:: set community <none|COMMUNITY> additive

   This command sets the community value in BGP updates.  If the attribute is
   already configured, the newly provided value replaces the old one unless the
   ``additive`` keyword is specified, in which case the new value is appended
   to the existing value.

   If ``none`` is specified as the community value, the communities attribute
   is not sent.

   It is not possible to set an expanded community list.

.. index:: set comm-list WORD delete
.. clicmd:: set comm-list WORD delete

   This command remove communities value from BGP communities attribute.  The
   ``word`` is community list name. When BGP route's communities value matches
   to the community list ``word``, the communities value is removed. When all
   of communities value is removed eventually, the BGP update's communities
   attribute is completely removed.

.. _bgp-communities-example:

Example Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following configuration is exemplary of the most typical usage of BGP
communities attribute. In the example, AS 7675 provides an upstream Internet
connection to AS 100. When the following configuration exists in AS 7675, the
network operator of AS 100 can set local preference in AS 7675 network by
setting BGP communities attribute to the updates.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 7675
    neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
    exit-address-family
   !
   bgp community-list 70 permit 7675:70
   bgp community-list 70 deny
   bgp community-list 80 permit 7675:80
   bgp community-list 80 deny
   bgp community-list 90 permit 7675:90
   bgp community-list 90 deny
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 10
    match community 70
    set local-preference 70
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 20
    match community 80
    set local-preference 80
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 30
    match community 90
    set local-preference 90


The following configuration announces ``10.0.0.0/8`` from AS 100 to AS 7675.
The route has communities value ``7675:80`` so when above configuration exists
in AS 7675, the announced routes' local preference value will be set to 80.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 100
    network 10.0.0.0/8
    neighbor 192.168.0.2 remote-as 7675
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 192.168.0.2 route-map RMAP out
    exit-address-family
   !
   ip prefix-list PLIST permit 10.0.0.0/8
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 10
    match ip address prefix-list PLIST
    set community 7675:80


The following configuration is an example of BGP route filtering using
communities attribute. This configuration only permit BGP routes which has BGP
communities value ``0:80`` or ``0:90``. The network operator can set special
internal communities value at BGP border router, then limit the BGP route
announcements into the internal network.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 7675
    neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
    exit-address-family
   !
   bgp community-list 1 permit 0:80 0:90
   !
   route-map RMAP permit in
    match community 1


The following example filters BGP routes which have a community value of
``1:1``. When there is no match community-list returns ``deny``. To avoid
filtering all routes, a ``permit`` line is set at the end of the
community-list.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 7675
    neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
    exit-address-family
   !
   bgp community-list standard FILTER deny 1:1
   bgp community-list standard FILTER permit
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 10
    match community FILTER


The communities value keyword ``internet`` has special meanings in standard
community lists. In the below example ``internet`` matches all BGP routes even
if the route does not have communities attribute at all. So community list
``INTERNET`` is the same as ``FILTER`` in the previous example.

.. code-block:: frr

   bgp community-list standard INTERNET deny 1:1
   bgp community-list standard INTERNET permit internet


The following configuration is an example of communities value deletion.  With
this configuration the community values ``100:1`` and ``100:2`` are removed
from BGP updates. For communities value deletion, only ``permit``
community-list is used. ``deny`` community-list is ignored.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 7675
    neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
    exit-address-family
   !
   bgp community-list standard DEL permit 100:1 100:2
   !
   route-map RMAP permit 10
    set comm-list DEL delete


.. _bgp-extended-communities-attribute:

Extended Communities Attribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BGP extended communities attribute is introduced with MPLS VPN/BGP technology.
MPLS VPN/BGP expands capability of network infrastructure to provide VPN
functionality. At the same time it requires a new framework for policy routing.
With BGP Extended Communities Attribute we can use Route Target or Site of
Origin for implementing network policy for MPLS VPN/BGP.

BGP Extended Communities Attribute is similar to BGP Communities Attribute. It
is an optional transitive attribute. BGP Extended Communities Attribute can
carry multiple Extended Community value.  Each Extended Community value is
eight octet length.

BGP Extended Communities Attribute provides an extended range compared with BGP
Communities Attribute. Adding to that there is a type field in each value to
provides community space structure.

There are two format to define Extended Community value. One is AS based format
the other is IP address based format.

``AS:VAL``
   This is a format to define AS based Extended Community value.  ``AS`` part
   is 2 octets Global Administrator subfield in Extended Community value.
   ``VAL`` part is 4 octets Local Administrator subfield. ``7675:100``
   represents AS 7675 policy value 100.

``IP-Address:VAL``
   This is a format to define IP address based Extended Community value.
   ``IP-Address`` part is 4 octets Global Administrator subfield.  ``VAL`` part
   is 2 octets Local Administrator subfield.

.. _bgp-extended-community-lists:

Extended Community Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: bgp extcommunity-list standard NAME permit|deny EXTCOMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp extcommunity-list standard NAME permit|deny EXTCOMMUNITY

   This command defines a new standard extcommunity-list. `extcommunity` is
   extended communities value. The `extcommunity` is compiled into extended
   community structure. We can define multiple extcommunity-list under same
   name. In that case match will happen user defined order. Once the
   extcommunity-list matches to extended communities attribute in BGP updates
   it return permit or deny based upon the extcommunity-list definition. When
   there is no matched entry, deny will be returned. When `extcommunity` is
   empty it matches to any routes.

.. index:: bgp extcommunity-list expanded NAME permit|deny LINE
.. clicmd:: bgp extcommunity-list expanded NAME permit|deny LINE

   This command defines a new expanded extcommunity-list. `line` is a string
   expression of extended communities attribute. `line` can be a regular
   expression (:ref:`bgp-regular-expressions`) to match an extended communities
   attribute in BGP updates.

.. index:: no bgp extcommunity-list NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp extcommunity-list NAME

.. index:: no bgp extcommunity-list standard NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp extcommunity-list standard NAME

.. index:: no bgp extcommunity-list expanded NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp extcommunity-list expanded NAME

   These commands delete extended community lists specified by `name`. All of
   extended community lists shares a single name space. So extended community
   lists can be removed simply specifying the name.

.. index:: show bgp extcommunity-list
.. clicmd:: show bgp extcommunity-list

.. index:: show bgp extcommunity-list NAME detail
.. clicmd:: show bgp extcommunity-list NAME detail

   This command displays current extcommunity-list information. When `name` is
   specified the community list's information is shown.::

      # show bgp extcommunity-list


.. _bgp-extended-communities-in-route-map:

BGP Extended Communities in Route Map
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. index:: match extcommunity WORD
.. clicmd:: match extcommunity WORD

.. index:: set extcommunity rt EXTCOMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: set extcommunity rt EXTCOMMUNITY

   This command set Route Target value.

.. index:: set extcommunity soo EXTCOMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: set extcommunity soo EXTCOMMUNITY

   This command set Site of Origin value.

.. index:: set extcommunity bandwidth <(1-25600) | cumulative | num-multipaths> [non-transitive]
.. clicmd:: set extcommunity bandwidth <(1-25600) | cumulative | num-multipaths> [non-transitive]

   This command sets the BGP link-bandwidth extended community for the prefix
   (best path) for which it is applied. The link-bandwidth can be specified as
   an ``explicit value`` (specified in Mbps), or the router can be told to use
   the ``cumulative bandwidth`` of all multipaths for the prefix or to compute
   it based on the ``number of multipaths``.  The link bandwidth extended
   community is encoded as ``transitive`` unless the set command explicitly
   configures it as ``non-transitive``.

.. seealso:: :ref:`wecmp_linkbw`

Note that the extended expanded community is only used for `match` rule, not for
`set` actions.

.. _bgp-large-communities-attribute:

Large Communities Attribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BGP Large Communities attribute was introduced in Feb 2017 with
:rfc:`8092`.

The BGP Large Communities Attribute is similar to the BGP Communities Attribute
except that it has 3 components instead of two and each of which are 4 octets
in length. Large Communities bring additional functionality and convenience
over traditional communities, specifically the fact that the ``GLOBAL`` part
below is now 4 octets wide allowing seamless use in networks using 4-byte ASNs.

``GLOBAL:LOCAL1:LOCAL2``
   This is the format to define Large Community values. Referencing :rfc:`8195`
   the values are commonly referred to as follows:

   - The ``GLOBAL`` part is a 4 octet Global Administrator field, commonly used
     as the operators AS number.
   - The ``LOCAL1`` part is a 4 octet Local Data Part 1 subfield referred to as
     a function.
   - The ``LOCAL2`` part is a 4 octet Local Data Part 2 field and referred to
     as the parameter subfield.

   As an example, ``65551:1:10`` represents AS 65551 function 1 and parameter
   10. The referenced RFC above gives some guidelines on recommended usage.

.. _bgp-large-community-lists:

Large Community Lists
"""""""""""""""""""""

Two types of large community lists are supported, namely `standard` and
`expanded`.

.. index:: bgp large-community-list standard NAME permit|deny LARGE-COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: bgp large-community-list standard NAME permit|deny LARGE-COMMUNITY

   This command defines a new standard large-community-list.  `large-community`
   is the Large Community value. We can add multiple large communities under
   same name. In that case the match will happen in the user defined order.
   Once the large-community-list matches the Large Communities attribute in BGP
   updates it will return permit or deny based upon the large-community-list
   definition. When there is no matched entry, a deny will be returned. When
   `large-community` is empty it matches any routes.

.. index:: bgp large-community-list expanded NAME permit|deny LINE
.. clicmd:: bgp large-community-list expanded NAME permit|deny LINE

   This command defines a new expanded large-community-list. Where `line` is a
   string matching expression, it will be compared to the entire Large
   Communities attribute as a string, with each large-community in order from
   lowest to highest.  `line` can also be a regular expression which matches
   this Large Community attribute.

.. index:: no bgp large-community-list NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp large-community-list NAME

.. index:: no bgp large-community-list standard NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp large-community-list standard NAME

.. index:: no bgp large-community-list expanded NAME
.. clicmd:: no bgp large-community-list expanded NAME

   These commands delete Large Community lists specified by `name`. All Large
   Community lists share a single namespace.  This means Large Community lists
   can be removed by simply specifying the name.

.. index:: show bgp large-community-list
.. clicmd:: show bgp large-community-list

.. index:: show bgp large-community-list NAME detail
.. clicmd:: show bgp large-community-list NAME detail

   This command display current large-community-list information. When
   `name` is specified the community list information is shown.

.. index:: show ip bgp large-community-info
.. clicmd:: show ip bgp large-community-info

   This command displays the current large communities in use.

.. _bgp-large-communities-in-route-map:

Large Communities in Route Map
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. index:: match large-community LINE [exact-match]
.. clicmd:: match large-community LINE [exact-match]

   Where `line` can be a simple string to match, or a regular expression. It
   is very important to note that this match occurs on the entire
   large-community string as a whole, where each large-community is ordered
   from lowest to highest. When `exact-match` keyword is specified, match
   happen only when BGP updates have completely same large communities value
   specified in the large community list.

.. index:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY

.. index:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY LARGE-COMMUNITY
.. clicmd:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY LARGE-COMMUNITY

.. index:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY additive
.. clicmd:: set large-community LARGE-COMMUNITY additive

   These commands are used for setting large-community values. The first
   command will overwrite any large-communities currently present.
   The second specifies two large-communities, which overwrites the current
   large-community list. The third will add a large-community value without
   overwriting other values. Multiple large-community values can be specified.

Note that the large expanded community is only used for `match` rule, not for
`set` actions.

(Virtual Routing and Forwarding)` for IPv4 :rfc:`4364` and IPv6 :rfc:`4659`.
L3VPN routes, and their associated VRF MPLS labels, can be distributed to VPN
SAFI neighbors in the *default*, i.e., non VRF, BGP instance. VRF MPLS labels
are reached using *core* MPLS labels which are distributed using LDP or BGP
labeled unicast.  *bgpd* also supports inter-VRF route leaking.


.. _bgp-vrf-route-leaking:

VRF Route Leaking
-----------------

BGP routes may be leaked (i.e. copied) between a unicast VRF RIB and the VPN
SAFI RIB of the default VRF for use in MPLS-based L3VPNs. Unicast routes may
also be leaked between any VRFs (including the unicast RIB of the default BGP
instanced). A shortcut syntax is also available for specifying leaking from one
VRF to another VRF using the default instance's VPN RIB as the intemediary. A
common application of the VRF-VRF feature is to connect a customer's private
routing domain to a provider's VPN service. Leaking is configured from the
point of view of an individual VRF: ``import`` refers to routes leaked from VPN
to a unicast VRF, whereas ``export`` refers to routes leaked from a unicast VRF
to VPN.

Required parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Routes exported from a unicast VRF to the VPN RIB must be augmented by two
parameters:

- an :abbr:`RD (Route Distinguisher)`
- an :abbr:`RTLIST (Route-target List)`

Configuration for these exported routes must, at a minimum, specify these two
parameters.

Routes imported from the VPN RIB to a unicast VRF are selected according to
their RTLISTs.  Routes whose RTLIST contains at least one route-target in
common with the configured import RTLIST are leaked.  Configuration for these
imported routes must specify an RTLIST to be matched.

The RD, which carries no semantic value, is intended to make the route unique
in the VPN RIB among all routes of its prefix that originate from all the
customers and sites that are attached to the provider's VPN service.
Accordingly, each site of each customer is typically assigned an RD that is
unique across the entire provider network.

The RTLIST is a set of route-target extended community values whose purpose is
to specify route-leaking policy. Typically, a customer is assigned a single
route-target value for import and export to be used at all customer sites. This
configuration specifies a simple topology wherein a customer has a single
routing domain which is shared across all its sites. More complex routing
topologies are possible through use of additional route-targets to augment the
leaking of sets of routes in various ways.

When using the shortcut syntax for vrf-to-vrf leaking, the RD and RT are
auto-derived.

General configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration of route leaking between a unicast VRF RIB and the VPN SAFI RIB
of the default VRF is accomplished via commands in the context of a VRF
address-family:

.. index:: rd vpn export AS:NN|IP:nn
.. clicmd:: rd vpn export AS:NN|IP:nn

   Specifies the route distinguisher to be added to a route exported from the
   current unicast VRF to VPN.

.. index:: no rd vpn export [AS:NN|IP:nn]
.. clicmd:: no rd vpn export [AS:NN|IP:nn]

   Deletes any previously-configured export route distinguisher.

.. index:: rt vpn import|export|both RTLIST...
.. clicmd:: rt vpn import|export|both RTLIST...

   Specifies the route-target list to be attached to a route (export) or the
   route-target list to match against (import) when exporting/importing between
   the current unicast VRF and VPN.

   The RTLIST is a space-separated list of route-targets, which are BGP
   extended community values as described in
   :ref:`bgp-extended-communities-attribute`.

.. index:: no rt vpn import|export|both [RTLIST...]
.. clicmd:: no rt vpn import|export|both [RTLIST...]

   Deletes any previously-configured import or export route-target list.

.. index:: label vpn export (0..1048575)|auto
.. clicmd:: label vpn export (0..1048575)|auto

   Enables an MPLS label to be attached to a route exported from the current
   unicast VRF to VPN. If the value specified is ``auto``, the label value is
   automatically assigned from a pool maintained by the Zebra daemon. If Zebra
   is not running, or if this command is not configured, automatic label
   assignment will not complete, which will block corresponding route export.

.. index:: no label vpn export [(0..1048575)|auto]
.. clicmd:: no label vpn export [(0..1048575)|auto]

   Deletes any previously-configured export label.

.. index:: nexthop vpn export A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X
.. clicmd:: nexthop vpn export A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X

   Specifies an optional nexthop value to be assigned to a route exported from
   the current unicast VRF to VPN. If left unspecified, the nexthop will be set
   to 0.0.0.0 or 0:0::0:0 (self).

.. index:: no nexthop vpn export [A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X]
.. clicmd:: no nexthop vpn export [A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X]

   Deletes any previously-configured export nexthop.

.. index:: route-map vpn import|export MAP
.. clicmd:: route-map vpn import|export MAP

   Specifies an optional route-map to be applied to routes imported or exported
   between the current unicast VRF and VPN.

.. index:: no route-map vpn import|export [MAP]
.. clicmd:: no route-map vpn import|export [MAP]

   Deletes any previously-configured import or export route-map.

.. index:: import|export vpn
.. clicmd:: import|export vpn

   Enables import or export of routes between the current unicast VRF and VPN.

.. index:: no import|export vpn
.. clicmd:: no import|export vpn

   Disables import or export of routes between the current unicast VRF and VPN.

.. index:: import vrf VRFNAME
.. clicmd:: import vrf VRFNAME

   Shortcut syntax for specifying automatic leaking from vrf VRFNAME to
   the current VRF using the VPN RIB as intermediary.  The RD and RT
   are auto derived and should not be specified explicitly for either the
   source or destination VRF's.

   This shortcut syntax mode is not compatible with the explicit
   `import vpn` and `export vpn` statements for the two VRF's involved.
   The CLI will disallow attempts to configure incompatible leaking
   modes.

.. index:: no import vrf VRFNAME
.. clicmd:: no import vrf VRFNAME

   Disables automatic leaking from vrf VRFNAME to the current VRF using
   the VPN RIB as intermediary.


.. _bgp-evpn:

Ethernet Virtual Network - EVPN
-------------------------------

.. _bgp-evpn-advertise-pip:

EVPN advertise-PIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a EVPN symmetric routing MLAG deployment, all EVPN routes advertised
with anycast-IP as next-hop IP and anycast MAC as the Router MAC (RMAC - in
BGP EVPN Extended-Community).
EVPN picks up the next-hop IP from the VxLAN interface's local tunnel IP and
the RMAC is obtained from the MAC of the L3VNI's SVI interface.
Note: Next-hop IP is used for EVPN routes whether symmetric routing is
deployed or not but the RMAC is only relevant for symmetric routing scenario.

Current behavior is not ideal for Prefix (type-5) and self (type-2)
routes. This is because the traffic from remote VTEPs routed sub optimally
if they land on the system where the route does not belong.

The advertise-pip feature advertises Prefix (type-5) and self (type-2)
routes with system's individual (primary) IP as the next-hop and individual
(system) MAC as Router-MAC (RMAC), while leaving the behavior unchanged for
other EVPN routes.

To support this feature there needs to have ability to co-exist a
(system-MAC, system-IP) pair with a (anycast-MAC, anycast-IP) pair with the
ability to terminate VxLAN-encapsulated packets received for either pair on
the same L3VNI (i.e associated VLAN). This capability is need per tenant
VRF instance.

To derive the system-MAC and the anycast MAC, there needs to have a
separate/additional MAC-VLAN interface corresponding to L3VNI’s SVI.
The SVI interface’s MAC address can be interpreted as system-MAC
and MAC-VLAN interface's MAC as anycast MAC.

To derive system-IP and anycast-IP, the default BGP instance's router-id is used
as system-IP and the VxLAN interface’s local tunnel IP as the anycast-IP.

User has an option to configure the system-IP and/or system-MAC value if the
auto derived value is not preferred.

Note: By default, advertise-pip feature is enabled and user has an option to
disable the feature via configuration CLI. Once the feature is disable under
bgp vrf instance or MAC-VLAN interface is not configured, all the routes follow
the same behavior of using same next-hop and RMAC values.

.. index:: [no] advertise-pip [ip <addr> [mac <addr>]]
.. clicmd:: [no] advertise-pip [ip <addr> [mac <addr>]]

Enables or disables advertise-pip feature, specifiy system-IP and/or system-MAC
parameters.

.. _bgp-cisco-compatibility:

Cisco Compatibility
-------------------

FRR has commands that change some configuration syntax and default behavior to
behave more closely to Cisco conventions. These are deprecated and will be
removed in a future version of FRR.

.. deprecated:: 5.0
   Please transition to using the FRR specific syntax for your configuration.

.. index:: bgp config-type cisco
.. clicmd:: bgp config-type cisco

   Cisco compatible BGP configuration output.

   When this configuration line is specified:

   - ``no synchronization`` is displayed.  This command does nothing and is for
     display purposes only.
   - ``no auto-summary`` is displayed.
   - The ``network`` and ``aggregate-address`` arguments are displayed as:

     ::

        A.B.C.D M.M.M.M

        FRR: network 10.0.0.0/8
        Cisco: network 10.0.0.0

        FRR: aggregate-address 192.168.0.0/24
        Cisco: aggregate-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0

   Community attribute handling is also different. If no configuration is
   specified community attribute and extended community attribute are sent to
   the neighbor. If a user manually disables the feature, the community
   attribute is not sent to the neighbor. When ``bgp config-type cisco`` is
   specified, the community attribute is not sent to the neighbor by default.
   To send the community attribute user has to specify
   :clicmd:`neighbor A.B.C.D send-community` like so:

   .. code-block:: frr

      !
      router bgp 1
       neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 1
       address-family ipv4 unicast
        no neighbor 10.0.0.1 send-community
       exit-address-family
      !
      router bgp 1
       neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 1
       address-family ipv4 unicast
        neighbor 10.0.0.1 send-community
       exit-address-family
      !

.. deprecated:: 5.0
   Please transition to using the FRR specific syntax for your configuration.

Dumping Messages and Routing Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: dump bgp all PATH [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: dump bgp all PATH [INTERVAL]

.. index:: dump bgp all-et PATH [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: dump bgp all-et PATH [INTERVAL]

.. index:: no dump bgp all [PATH] [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: no dump bgp all [PATH] [INTERVAL]

   Dump all BGP packet and events to `path` file.
   If `interval` is set, a new file will be created for echo `interval` of
   seconds.  The path `path` can be set with date and time formatting
   (strftime).  The type ‘all-et’ enables support for Extended Timestamp Header
   (:ref:`packet-binary-dump-format`).

.. index:: dump bgp updates PATH [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: dump bgp updates PATH [INTERVAL]

.. index:: dump bgp updates-et PATH [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: dump bgp updates-et PATH [INTERVAL]

.. index:: no dump bgp updates [PATH] [INTERVAL]
.. clicmd:: no dump bgp updates [PATH] [INTERVAL]

   Dump only BGP updates messages to `path` file.
   If `interval` is set, a new file will be created for echo `interval` of
   seconds.  The path `path` can be set with date and time formatting
   (strftime).  The type ‘updates-et’ enables support for Extended Timestamp
   Header (:ref:`packet-binary-dump-format`).

.. index:: dump bgp routes-mrt PATH
.. clicmd:: dump bgp routes-mrt PATH

.. index:: dump bgp routes-mrt PATH INTERVAL

   Dump whole BGP routing table to `path`. This is heavy process. The path
   `path` can be set with date and time formatting (strftime). If `interval` is
   set, a new file will be created for echo `interval` of seconds.

   Note: the interval variable can also be set using hours and minutes: 04h20m00.


.. _bgp-other-commands:

Other BGP Commands
------------------

The following are available in the top level *enable* mode:

.. index:: clear bgp \*
.. clicmd:: clear bgp \*

   Clear all peers.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 \*
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 \*

   Clear all peers with this address-family activated.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast \*
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast \*

   Clear all peers with this address-family and sub-address-family activated.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 PEER
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 PEER

   Clear peers with address of X.X.X.X and this address-family activated.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast PEER
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast PEER

   Clear peer with address of X.X.X.X and this address-family and sub-address-family activated.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 PEER soft|in|out
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 PEER soft|in|out

   Clear peer using soft reconfiguration in this address-family.

.. index:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast PEER soft|in|out
.. clicmd:: clear bgp ipv4|ipv6 unicast PEER soft|in|out

   Clear peer using soft reconfiguration in this address-family and sub-address-family.

The following are available in the ``router bgp`` mode:

.. index:: write-quanta (1-64)
.. clicmd:: write-quanta (1-64)

   BGP message Tx I/O is vectored. This means that multiple packets are written
   to the peer socket at the same time each I/O cycle, in order to minimize
   system call overhead. This value controls how many are written at a time.
   Under certain load conditions, reducing this value could make peer traffic
   less 'bursty'. In practice, leave this settings on the default (64) unless
   you truly know what you are doing.

.. index:: read-quanta (1-10)
.. clicmd:: read-quanta (1-10)

   Unlike Tx, BGP Rx traffic is not vectored. Packets are read off the wire one
   at a time in a loop. This setting controls how many iterations the loop runs
   for. As with write-quanta, it is best to leave this setting on the default.

.. _bgp-displaying-bgp-information:

Displaying BGP Information
==========================

The following four commands display the IPv6 and IPv4 routing tables, depending
on whether or not the ``ip`` keyword is used.
Actually, :clicmd:`show ip bgp` command was used on older `Quagga` routing
daemon project, while :clicmd:`show bgp` command is the new format. The choice
has been done to keep old format with IPv4 routing table, while new format
displays IPv6 routing table.

.. index:: show ip bgp
.. clicmd:: show ip bgp

.. index:: show ip bgp A.B.C.D
.. clicmd:: show ip bgp A.B.C.D

.. index:: show bgp
.. clicmd:: show bgp

.. index:: show bgp X:X::X:X
.. clicmd:: show bgp X:X::X:X

   These commands display BGP routes. When no route is specified, the default
   is to display all BGP routes.

   ::

      BGP table version is 0, local router ID is 10.1.1.1
         Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal
         Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete

      Network    Next Hop      Metric LocPrf Weight Path
         \*> 1.1.1.1/32       0.0.0.0      0   32768 i

         Total number of prefixes 1

Some other commands provide additional options for filtering the output.

.. index:: show [ip] bgp regexp LINE
.. clicmd:: show [ip] bgp regexp LINE

   This command displays BGP routes using AS path regular expression
   (:ref:`bgp-regular-expressions`).

.. index:: show [ip] bgp summary
.. clicmd:: show [ip] bgp summary

   Show a bgp peer summary for the specified address family.

The old command structure :clicmd:`show ip bgp` may be removed in the future
and should no longer be used. In order to reach the other BGP routing tables
other than the IPv6 routing table given by :clicmd:`show bgp`, the new command
structure is extended with :clicmd:`show bgp [afi] [safi]`.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi]
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi]

.. index:: show bgp <ipv4|ipv6> <unicast|multicast|vpn|labeled-unicast>
.. clicmd:: show bgp <ipv4|ipv6> <unicast|multicast|vpn|labeled-unicast>

   These commands display BGP routes for the specific routing table indicated by
   the selected afi and the selected safi. If no afi and no safi value is given,
   the command falls back to the default IPv6 routing table.
   For EVPN prefixes, you can display the full BGP table for this AFI/SAFI
   using the standard `show bgp [afi] [safi]` syntax.

.. index:: show bgp l2vpn evpn route [type <macip|2|multicast|3|es|4|prefix|5>]
.. clicmd:: show bgp l2vpn evpn route [type <macip|2|multicast|3|es|4|prefix|5>]

   Additionally, you can also filter this output by route type.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] summary
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] summary

   Show a bgp peer summary for the specified address family, and subsequent
   address-family.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] summary failed [json]
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] summary failed [json]

   Show a bgp peer summary for peers that are not succesfully exchanging routes
   for the specified address family, and subsequent address-family.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] neighbor [PEER]
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] neighbor [PEER]

   This command shows information on a specific BGP peer of the relevant
   afi and safi selected.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] dampening dampened-paths
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] dampening dampened-paths

   Display paths suppressed due to dampening of the selected afi and safi
   selected.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] dampening flap-statistics
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] dampening flap-statistics

   Display flap statistics of routes of the selected afi and safi selected.

.. index:: show bgp [afi] [safi] statistics
.. clicmd:: show bgp [afi] [safi] statistics

   Display statistics of routes of the selected afi and safi.

.. index:: show bgp statistics-all
.. clicmd:: show bgp statistics-all

   Display statistics of routes of all the afi and safi.

.. _bgp-display-routes-by-community:

Displaying Routes by Community Attribute
----------------------------------------

The following commands allow displaying routes based on their community
attribute.

.. clicmd:: show [ip] bgp <ipv4|ipv6> community COMMUNITY

.. index:: show [ip] bgp <ipv4|ipv6> community COMMUNITY exact-match
.. clicmd:: show [ip] bgp <ipv4|ipv6> community COMMUNITY exact-match

   These commands display BGP routes which have the community attribute.
   attribute. When ``COMMUNITY`` is specified, BGP routes that match that
   community are displayed. When `exact-match` is specified, it display only
   routes that have an exact match.

   packet-queue specifies the list of packets in the queue to be sent.

.. index:: show bgp update-groups statistics
.. clicmd:: show bgp update-groups statistics

   Display Information about update-group events in FRR.

.. _bgp-route-reflector:

Route Reflector
===============

BGP routers connected inside the same AS through BGP belong to an internal
BGP session, or IBGP. In order to prevent routing table loops, IBGP does not
advertise IBGP-learned routes to other routers in the same session. As such,
IBGP requires a full mesh of all peers. For large networks, this quickly becomes
unscalable. Introducing route reflectors removes the need for the full-mesh.

When route reflectors are configured, these will reflect the routes announced
by the peers configured as clients. A route reflector client is configured
with:

.. index:: neighbor PEER route-reflector-client
.. clicmd:: neighbor PEER route-reflector-client

.. index:: no neighbor PEER route-reflector-client
.. clicmd:: no neighbor PEER route-reflector-client

To avoid single points of failure, multiple route reflectors can be configured.

A cluster is a collection of route reflectors and their clients, and is used
by route reflectors to avoid looping.

.. index:: bgp cluster-id A.B.C.D
.. clicmd:: bgp cluster-id A.B.C.D

.. _routing-policy:

Routing Policy
==============

You can set different routing policy for a peer. For example, you can set
different filter for a peer.

.. code-block:: frr

   !
   router bgp 1 view 1
    neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2

This means BGP update from a peer 10.0.0.1 goes to both BGP view 1 and view 2.
When the update is inserted into view 1, distribute-list 1 is applied. On the
other hand, when the update is inserted into view 2, distribute-list 2 is
applied.


.. _bgp-regular-expressions:

BGP Regular Expressions
=======================

BGP regular expressions are based on :t:`POSIX 1003.2` regular expressions. The
following description is just a quick subset of the POSIX regular expressions.


.\*
   Matches any single character.

\*
   Matches 0 or more occurrences of pattern.

\+
   Matches 1 or more occurrences of pattern.

?
   Match 0 or 1 occurrences of pattern.

^
   Matches the beginning of the line.

$
   Matches the end of the line.

_
   The ``_`` character has special meanings in BGP regular expressions.  It
   matches to space and comma , and AS set delimiter ``{`` and ``}`` and AS
   confederation delimiter ``(`` and ``)``. And it also matches to the
   beginning of the line and the end of the line. So ``_`` can be used for AS
   value boundaries match. This character technically evaluates to
   ``(^|[,{}()]|$)``.


.. _bgp-configuration-examples:

Miscellaneous Configuration Examples
====================================

Example of a session to an upstream, advertising only one prefix to it.

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 64512
    bgp router-id 10.236.87.1
    neighbor upstream peer-group
    neighbor upstream remote-as 64515
    neighbor upstream capability dynamic
    neighbor 10.1.1.1 peer-group upstream
    neighbor 10.1.1.1 description ACME ISP

    address-family ipv4 unicast
     network 10.236.87.0/24
     neighbor upstream prefix-list pl-allowed-adv out
    exit-address-family
   !
   ip prefix-list pl-allowed-adv seq 5 permit 82.195.133.0/25
   ip prefix-list pl-allowed-adv seq 10 deny any

A more complex example including upstream, peer and customer sessions
advertising global prefixes and NO_EXPORT prefixes and providing actions for
customer routes based on community values. Extensive use is made of route-maps
and the 'call' feature to support selective advertising of prefixes. This
example is intended as guidance only, it has NOT been tested and almost
certainly contains silly mistakes, if not serious flaws.

[#med-transitivity-rant] For some set of objects to have an order, there *must* be some binary ordering relation that is defined for *every* combination of those objects, and that relation *must* be transitive. I.e.:, if the relation operator is <, and if a < b and b < c then that relation must carry over and it *must* be that a < c for the objects to have an order. The ordering relation may allow for equality, i.e. a < b and b < a may both be true and imply that a and b are equal in the order and not distinguished by it, in which case the set has a partial order. Otherwise, if there is an order, all the objects have a distinct place in the order and the set has a total order)
