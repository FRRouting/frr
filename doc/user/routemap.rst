Route Maps
**********

Route maps provide a means to both filter and/or apply actions to route, hence
allowing policy to be applied to routes.

For a route reflector to apply a ``route-map`` to reflected routes, be sure to
include ``bgp route-reflector allow-outbound-policy`` in ``router bgp`` mode.

Route maps are an ordered list of route map entries. Each entry may specify up
to four distinct sets of clauses:

.. glossary::

   Matching Conditions
      A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more conditions which
      must be matched if the entry is to be considered further, as governed by
      the Match Policy. If a route-map entry does not explicitly specify any
      matching conditions, then it always matches.

   Set Actions
      A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more Set Actions to set
      or modify attributes of the route.

   Matching Policy
      This specifies the policy implied if the :term:`Matching Conditions` are
      met or not met, and which actions of the route-map are to be taken, if
      any. The two possibilities are:

      - :dfn:`permit`: If the entry matches, then carry out the
        :term:`Set Actions`. Then finish processing the route-map, permitting
        the route, unless an :term:`Exit Policy` action indicates otherwise.

      - :dfn:`deny`: If the entry matches, then finish processing the route-map and
        deny the route (return `deny`).

      The `Matching Policy` is specified as part of the command which defines
      the ordered entry in the route-map. See below.

   Call Action
      Call to another route-map, after any :term:`Set Actions` have been
      carried out.  If the route-map called returns `deny` then processing of
      the route-map finishes and the route is denied, regardless of the
      :term:`Matching Policy` or the :term:`Exit Policy`. If the called
      route-map returns `permit`, then :term:`Matching Policy` and :term:`Exit
      Policy` govern further behaviour, as normal.

   Exit Policy
      An entry may, optionally, specify an alternative :dfn:`Exit Policy` to
      take if the entry matched, rather than the normal policy of exiting the
      route-map and permitting the route. The two possibilities are:

      - :dfn:`next`: Continue on with processing of the route-map entries.

      - :dfn:`goto N`: Jump ahead to the first route-map entry whose order in
        the route-map is >= N. Jumping to a previous entry is not permitted.

The default action of a route-map, if no entries match, is to deny.  I.e. a
route-map essentially has as its last entry an empty *deny* entry, which
matches all routes. To change this behaviour, one must specify an empty
*permit* entry as the last entry in the route-map.

To summarise the above:

+--------+--------+----------+
|        | Match  | No Match |
+========+========+==========+
| Permit | action | cont     |
+--------+--------+----------+
| Deny   | deny   | cont     |
+--------+--------+----------+

action
   - Apply *set* statements
   - If *call* is present, call given route-map. If that returns a ``deny``,
     finish processing and return ``deny``.
   - If *Exit Policy* is *next*, goto next route-map entry
   - If *Exit Policy* is *goto*, goto first entry whose order in the
     list is >= the given order.
   - Finish processing the route-map and permit the route.

deny
   The route is denied by the route-map (return ``deny``).

cont
   goto next route-map entry

.. _route-map-optimization-command:

Route Map Optimization Command
==============================

.. index:: route-map optimization
.. clicmd:: route-map optimization

   Enable route-map processing optimization. The optimization is
   enabled by default.
   Instead of sequentially passing through all the route-map indexes
   until a match is found, the search for the best-match index will be
   based on a look-up in a prefix-tree. A per-route-map prefix-tree
   will be constructed for this purpose. The prefix-tree will compose
   of all the prefixes in all the prefix-lists that are included in the
   match rule of all the sequences of a route-map.

.. index:: no route-map optimization
.. clicmd:: no route-map optimization

   Disable the route-map processing optimization.

Route Map Examples
==================

A simple example of a route-map:

.. code-block:: frr

   route-map test permit 10
    match ip address 10
    set local-preference 200


This means that if a route matches ip access-list number 10 it's
local-preference value is set to 200.

See :ref:`bgp-configuration-examples` for examples of more sophisticated
usage of route-maps, including of the ``call`` action.
