Route Maps
**********

Route maps provide a means to both filter and/or apply actions to route, hence
allowing policy to be applied to routes.

For a route reflector to apply a ``route-map`` to reflected routes, be sure to
include ``bgp route-reflector allow-outbound-policy`` in ``router bgp`` mode.

Route maps are an ordered list of route map entries. Each entry may specify up
to four distinct sets of clauses:

.. glossary::

   Matching Conditions
      A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more conditions which
      must be matched if the entry is to be considered further, as governed by
      the Match Policy. If a route-map entry does not explicitly specify any
      matching conditions, then it always matches.

   Set Actions
      A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more Set Actions to set
      or modify attributes of the route.

   Matching Policy
      This specifies the policy implied if the :term:`Matching Conditions` are
      met or not met, and which actions of the route-map are to be taken, if
      any. The two possibilities are:

      - :dfn:`permit`: If the entry matches, then carry out the
        :term:`Set Actions`. Then finish processing the route-map, permitting
        the route, unless an :term:`Exit Policy` action indicates otherwise.

      - :dfn:`deny`: If the entry matches, then finish processing the route-map and
        deny the route (return `deny`).

      The `Matching Policy` is specified as part of the command which defines
      the ordered entry in the route-map. See below.

   Call Action
      Call to another route-map, after any :term:`Set Actions` have been
      carried out.  If the route-map called returns `deny` then processing of
      the route-map finishes and the route is denied, regardless of the
      :term:`Matching Policy` or the :term:`Exit Policy`. If the called
      route-map returns `permit`, then :term:`Matching Policy` and :term:`Exit
      Policy` govern further behaviour, as normal.

   Exit Policy
      An entry may, optionally, specify an alternative :dfn:`Exit Policy` to
      take if the entry matched, rather than the normal policy of exiting the
      route-map and permitting the route. The two possibilities are:

      - :dfn:`next`: Continue on with processing of the route-map entries.

      - :dfn:`goto N`: Jump ahead to the first route-map entry whose order in
        the route-map is >= N. Jumping to a previous entry is not permitted.

The default action of a route-map, if no entries match, is to deny.  I.e. a
route-map essentially has as its last entry an empty *deny* entry, which
matches all routes. To change this behaviour, one must specify an empty
*permit* entry as the last entry in the route-map.

To summarise the above:

+--------+--------+----------+
|        | Match  | No Match |
+========+========+==========+
| Permit | action | cont     |
+--------+--------+----------+
| Deny   | deny   | cont     |
+--------+--------+----------+

action
   - Apply *set* statements
   - If *call* is present, call given route-map. If that returns a ``deny``,
     finish processing and return ``deny``.
   - If *Exit Policy* is *next*, goto next route-map entry
   - If *Exit Policy* is *goto*, goto first entry whose order in the
     list is >= the given order.
   - Finish processing the route-map and permit the route.

deny
   The route is denied by the route-map (return ``deny``).

cont
   goto next route-map entry

   Additionally if you have compiled with the :option:`--enable-realms`
   configure option. Tag values from (1-255) are sent to the Linux kernel as a

   a note realms cannot currently be used with the installation of nexthops
   as nexthop groups in the linux kernel.

.. clicmd:: set ip next-hop IPV4_ADDRESS

   Set the BGP nexthop address to the specified IPV4_ADDRESS.  For both
   incoming and outgoing route-maps.

.. clicmd:: set ip next-hop peer-address

   Set the BGP nexthop address to the address of the peer.  For an incoming
   route-map this means the ip address of our peer is used.  For an outgoing
   route-map this means the ip address of our self is used to establish the
   peering with our neighbor.

.. clicmd:: set ip next-hop unchanged

   Set the route-map as unchanged.  Pass the route-map through without
   changing it's value.

.. clicmd:: set ipv6 next-hop peer-address

   Set the BGP nexthop address to the address of the peer.  For an incoming
   route-map this means the ipv6 address of our peer is used.  For an outgoing
   route-map this means the ip address of our self is used to establish the
   peering with our neighbor.

.. clicmd:: set ipv6 next-hop prefer-global

   For Incoming and Import Route-maps if we receive a v6 global and v6 LL
   address for the route, then prefer to use the global address as the nexthop.

.. clicmd:: set local-preference -LOCAL_PREF

   Subtract the BGP local preference from an existing `local_pref`.

.. clicmd:: set distance (1-255)

   Set the Administrative distance to use for the route.
   This is only locally significant and will not be dispersed to peers.

.. clicmd:: set weight WEIGHT

   Set the route's weight.

.. clicmd:: set metric <[+|-](1-4294967295)|rtt|+rtt|-rtt>

   Set the route metric. When used with BGP, set the BGP attribute MED to a
   specific value. Use `+`/`-` to add or subtract the specified value to/from
   the existing/MED. Use `rtt` to set the MED to the round trip time or
   `+rtt`/`-rtt` to add/subtract the round trip time to/from the MED.

.. clicmd:: set min-metric <(0-4294967295)>

   Set the minimum meric for the route.

.. clicmd:: set max-metric <(0-4294967295)>

   then the value is taken from the IGP protocol, otherwise an arbitrary value.

.. clicmd:: set as-path prepend AS_PATH

   Set the BGP AS path to prepend.

.. clicmd:: set as-path exclude AS-NUMBER...

   Drop AS-NUMBER from the BGP AS path.

   Policy is uniquely determined by the color and the BGP nexthop.

.. clicmd:: set l3vpn next-hop encapsulation gre

   Accept L3VPN traffic over GRE encapsulation.

.. _route-map-call-command:

Route Map Call Command
======================

.. clicmd:: call NAME

   Call route-map `name`. If it returns deny, deny the route and
   finish processing the route-map.


.. _route-map-exit-action-command:

Route Map Exit Action Command
=============================

.. clicmd:: on-match next

.. clicmd:: continue

   Proceed on to the next entry in the route-map.

.. clicmd:: on-match goto N

.. clicmd:: continue N

   Proceed processing the route-map at the first entry whose order is >= N


.. _route-map-optimization-command:

Route Map Optimization Command
==============================

.. clicmd:: route-map ROUTE-MAP-NAME optimization

   Enable route-map processing optimization for `route-map-name`.
   The optimization is enabled by default.
   Instead of sequentially passing through all the route-map indexes
   until a match is found, the search for the best-match index will be
   based on a look-up in a prefix-tree. A per-route-map prefix-tree
   will be constructed for this purpose. The prefix-tree will compose
   of all the prefixes in all the prefix-lists that are included in the
   match rule of all the sequences of a route-map.


Route Map Examples
==================

A simple example of a route-map:

.. code-block:: frr

   route-map test permit 10
    match ip address 10
    set local-preference 200


This means that if a route matches ip access-list number 10 it's
local-preference value is set to 200.

See :ref:`bgp-configuration-examples` for examples of more sophisticated
usage of route-maps, including of the ``call`` action.
