PATH
****

:abbr:`PATH` is a daemon that handles the installation and deletion
of Segment Routing (SR) Policies.
Based on MPLS (This means that your OS of choice must support MPLS),
SR add a stack of MPLS labels to ingress packets so these
packets are egress through the desired path.

.. image:: images/pathd_general.png

The SR policies and Segment Lists can be configured either locally by means
of vtysh or centralized based on a SDN controller (ODL, Cisco, ...)
communicating using the PCEP protocol (:rfc:`5440`).

Configuration
=============

Explicit Segment Lists
----------------------

This is the simplest way of configuration, no remote PCE is necessary.
In order to create a config that match the graphics used in this documentation,
we will create a segment list (SL) called SL1 with an element for each hop and
that element will be assigned a MPLS label.
Then the SL1 will be used in the policy ``example1``, please note also the
preference as in the case of multiple segment list it will be used with the
criteria of bigger number more preference.
Let see now the final configuration that match the graphics shown above.


.. code-block:: frr

   segment-routing
    traffic-eng
     segment-list SL1
      index 10  mpls label 16001
      index 20  mpls label 16002
     !
     policy color 1 endpoint 192.0.2.4
      name example1
      binding-sid 1111
      candidate-path preference 100 name CP1 explicit segment-list SL1


Explicit Segment Lists and Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes is difficult to know the values of MPLS labels
(adjacency changes,...).
Based on the support of IS-IS or OSPF we can activate TED support what will
allow pathd to resolve MPLS based in different types of segments
(:rfc: `draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy-07`). The supported types are
Type C (prefix and local interface), Type E (prefix and algorithm),
Type F (a pair of IP's).
So the configuration would change to this

.. code-block:: frr

   segment-routing
    traffic-eng
     mpls-te on
     mpls-te import ospfv2
     segment-list SL1
      index 10  nai prefix 10.1.2.1/32 iface 1
      index 20  nai adjacency 10.1.20.1 10.1.20.2
     !
     policy color 1 endpoint 192.0.2.4
      name example1
      binding-sid 1111
      candidate-path preference 100 name CP1 explicit segment-list SL1


In this case no MPLS are provided but the pathd TED support will resolve the
configuration provided to corresponding MPLS labels.

.. note::
	Please note the ``mpls-te`` configuration added that activate the TED
	support and points to ``ospfv2`` so
	the ospfv2 (:ref:`ospf-traffic-engineering`) daemon must be also
	running and configure to export TED information.

.. note::
	It would be the same for isis (:ref:`isis-traffic-engineering`) but in the
	moment of writting it's not fully tested.

Dynamic Segment Lists
---------------------

One of the useful options to configure is the creation of policies with
the dynamic option. In this case based on a given endpoint the SL will be
,first calculated, and then sended by means of PCEP protocol by the configured
PCE.

.. code-block:: frr

   traffic-eng
    !
    pcep
     !
     pce PCE1
      address ip 192.0.2.10
     !
     pcc
      peer PCE1 precedence 10
    !
    policy color 1 endpoint 192.0.2.4
     name example
     binding-sid 1111
     candidate-path preference 100 name CP2 dynamic

.. note::
	Please note the configuration for the remote pce which allows pathd to
	connect to the given PCE and act as a PCC (PCEP Client)

.. note::
	If the TED support feature is active, the data obtained from PCE will
	be validated, so in a SL from PCEP/PCE the IP and MPLS will be checked
	against local TED obtained and built from the igp configured in that
	case.

.. image:: images/pathd_config.png

Pce Initiated
-------------

We can step forward in the use of our controller not only by asking to
calculate paths to an endpoint but also to create the whole policies in the
controller and obtain those by means of the PCEP protocol.


.. code-block:: frr

   traffic-eng
    !
    pcep
     !
     pce PCE1
      address ip 192.0.2.10
      pce-initiated
     !
     pce PCE2
      address ip 192.0.2.9
      pce-initiated
     !
     pcc
      peer PCE1 precedence 10
      peer PCE2 precedence 20
    !

.. note::
	Now there is no locally created policies in the config as they will
	be obtain from the configured pce.
	Please check command :clicmd:`show sr-te policy` in ``vtysh`` to see
	the obtained policies.

.. note::
	Another interesting command is :clicmd:`show mpls table`
	to check the installed mpls configuration based in those obtained
	policies.

.. note::
	SR Policies could be a mix of local, remote obtained from PCE and
	delegated to a PCE (but while testing Pce Initiated with Cisco PCE,
	happens that controller sends PCE initiated delete commands to delete
	the locally created configuration related to that PCE).


.. image:: images/pathd_initiated_multi.png

Starting
========

Default configuration file for *pathd* is :file:`pathd.conf`.  The typical
location of :file:`pathd.conf` is |INSTALL_PREFIX_ETC|/pathd.conf.

If the user is using integrated config, then :file:`pathd.conf` need not be
present and the :file:`frr.conf` is read instead.

.. program:: pathd

:abbr:`PATH` supports all the common FRR daemon start options which are
documented elsewhere.

PCEP Support
============

A pceplib is included in the frr source tree and build by default.


To start pathd with pcep support the extra parameter `-M pathd_pcep` should be
passed to the pathd daemon.

An example of command line with pcep module could be this

.. code-block:: frr

  pathd -u root -g root -f pathd.conf -z /tmp/zebra-demo1.sock --vty_socket=/var/run/demo1.vty -i /tmp/pathd-demo1.pid -M frr/modules/pathd_pcep.so --log file:/tmp/kk.txt

Usage with BGP route-maps
=========================

It is possible to steer traffic 'into' a segment routing policy for routes
learned through BGP using route-maps:

.. code-block:: frr

  route-map SET_SR_POLICY permit 10
   set sr-te color 1
  !
  router bgp 1
   bgp router-id 192.0.2.2
   neighbor 192.0.2.1 remote-as 1
   neighbor 192.0.2.1 update-source lo
   !
   address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 192.0.2.1 next-hop-self
    neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map SET_SR_POLICY in
    redistribute static
   exit-address-family
   !
  !

In this case, the SR Policy with color `1` and endpoint `192.0.2.1` is selected.
