Zebra
*****

*zebra* is an IP routing manager. It provides kernel routing
table updates, interface lookups, and redistribution of routes between
different routing protocols.

.. _invoking-zebra:

Invoking zebra
==============

Besides the common invocation options (:ref:`common-invocation-options`), the
*zebra* specific invocation options are listed below.

.. program:: zebra

.. option:: -b, --batch

   Runs in batch mode. *zebra* parses configuration file and terminates
   immediately.

.. option:: -K TIME, --graceful_restart TIME

   If this option is specified, the graceful restart time is TIME seconds.
   Zebra, when started, will read in routes.  Those routes that Zebra
   identifies that it was the originator of will be swept in TIME seconds.
   If no time is specified then we will sweep those routes immediately.

.. option:: -r, --retain

   When program terminates, do not flush routes installed by *zebra* from the
   kernel.

.. option:: -e X, --ecmp X

   Run zebra with a limited ecmp ability compared to what it is compiled to.
   If you are running zebra on hardware limited functionality you can
   force zebra to limit the maximum ecmp allowed to X.  This number
   is bounded by what you compiled FRR with as the maximum number.

.. option:: -n, --vrfwnetns

   When *Zebra* starts with this option, the VRF backend is based on Linux
   network namespaces. That implies that all network namespaces discovered by
   ZEBRA will create an associated VRF. The other daemons will operate on the VRF
   VRF defined by *Zebra*, as usual.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`zebra-vrf`

.. option:: -o, --vrfdefaultname

   When *Zebra* starts with this option, the default VRF name is changed to the
   parameter.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`zebra-vrf`

.. option:: -z <path_to_socket>, --socket <path_to_socket>

   If this option is supplied on the cli, the path to the zebra
   control socket(zapi), is used.  This option overrides a -N <namespace>
   option if handed to it on the cli.

.. option:: --v6-rr-semantics

   The linux kernel is receiving the ability to use the same route
   replacement semantics for v6 that v4 uses.  If you are using a
   kernel that supports this functionality then run *Zebra* with this
   option and we will use Route Replace Semantics instead of delete
   than add.

.. option:: --asic-offload [notify_on_offload|notify_on_ack]

   The linux kernel has the ability to use asic-offload ( see switchdev
   development ).  When the operator knows that FRR will be working in
   this way, allow them to specify this with FRR.  At this point this
   code only supports asynchronous notification of the offload state.
   In other words the initial ACK received for linux kernel installation
   does not give zebra any data about what the state of the offload
   is.  This option takes the optional paramegers notify_on_offload
   or notify_on_ack.  This signals to zebra to notify upper level
   protocols about route installation/update on ack received from
   the linux kernel or from offload notification.

.. _interface-commands:

Configuration Addresses behaviour
=================================

At startup, *Zebra* will first discover the underlying networking objects
from the operating system. This includes interfaces, addresses of
interfaces, static routes, etc. Then, it will read the configuration
file, including its own interface addresses, static routes, etc. All this
information comprises the operational context from *Zebra*. But
configuration context from *Zebra* will remain the same as the one from
:file:`zebra.conf` config file. As an example, executing the following
:clicmd:`show running-config` will reflect what was in :file:`zebra.conf`.
In a similar way, networking objects that are configured outside of the
*Zebra* like *iproute2* will not impact the configuration context from
*Zebra*. This behaviour permits you to continue saving your own config
file, and decide what is really to be pushed on the config file, and what
is dependent on the underlying system.
Note that inversely, from *Zebra*, you will not be able to delete networking
objects that were previously configured outside of *Zebra*.


Interface Commands
==================

.. _standard-commands:

Standard Commands
-----------------


.. clicmd:: interface IFNAME


.. clicmd:: interface IFNAME vrf VRF


.. clicmd:: shutdown


   Up or down the current interface.


.. clicmd:: ip address ADDRESS/PREFIX

.. clicmd:: ipv6 address ADDRESS/PREFIX



   Set the IPv4 or IPv6 address/prefix for the interface.


.. clicmd:: ip address LOCAL-ADDR peer PEER-ADDR/PREFIX


   Configure an IPv4 Point-to-Point address on the interface. (The concept of
   PtP addressing does not exist for IPv6.)

   `local-addr` has no subnet mask since the local side in PtP addressing is
   always a single (/32) address. `peer-addr/prefix` can be an arbitrary subnet
   behind the other end of the link (or even on the link in Point-to-Multipoint
   setups), though generally /32s are used.


.. clicmd:: description DESCRIPTION ...

   Set description for the interface.


.. clicmd:: multicast


   Enable or disables multicast flag for the interface.


.. clicmd:: bandwidth (1-10000000)


   Set bandwidth value of the interface in kilobits/sec. This is for
   calculating OSPF cost. This command does not affect the actual device
   configuration.


.. clicmd:: link-detect


   Enable/disable link-detect on platforms which support this. Currently only
   Linux, and only where network interface drivers support reporting
   link-state via the ``IFF_RUNNING`` flag.

   In FRR, link-detect is on by default.

.. _link-parameters-commands:

Link Parameters Commands
------------------------

.. note::

   At this time, FRR offers partial support for some of the routing
   protocol extensions that can be used with MPLS-TE. FRR does not
   support a complete RSVP-TE solution currently.

.. clicmd:: link-params


   Enter into the link parameters sub node. At least 'enable' must be
   set to activate the link parameters, and consequently routing
   information that could be used as part of Traffic Engineering on
   this interface. MPLS-TE must be enable at the OSPF
   (:ref:`ospf-traffic-engineering`) or ISIS
   (:ref:`isis-traffic-engineering`) router level in complement to
   this.

   Under link parameter statement, the following commands set the different TE values:

.. clicmd:: enable

   Enable link parameters for this interface.

.. clicmd:: metric (0-4294967295)

.. clicmd:: max-bw BANDWIDTH

.. clicmd:: max-rsv-bw BANDWIDTH

.. clicmd:: unrsv-bw (0-7) BANDWIDTH

.. clicmd:: admin-grp BANDWIDTH

   These commands specifies the Traffic Engineering parameters of the interface
   in conformity to RFC3630 (OSPF) or RFC5305 (ISIS).  There are respectively
   the TE Metric (different from the OSPF or ISIS metric), Maximum Bandwidth
   (interface speed by default), Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, Unreserved
   Bandwidth for each 0-7 priority and Admin Group (ISIS) or Resource
   Class/Color (OSPF).

   Note that BANDIWDTH is specified in IEEE floating point format and express
   in Bytes/second.

.. clicmd:: delay (0-16777215) [min (0-16777215) | max (0-16777215)]

.. clicmd:: delay-variation (0-16777215)

.. clicmd:: packet-loss PERCENTAGE

.. clicmd:: res-bw BANDWIDTH

.. clicmd:: ava-bw BANDWIDTH

.. clicmd:: use-bw BANDWIDTH

   These command specifies additional Traffic Engineering parameters of the
   interface in conformity to draft-ietf-ospf-te-metrics-extension-05.txt and
   draft-ietf-isis-te-metrics-extension-03.txt. There are respectively the
   delay, jitter, loss, available bandwidth, reservable bandwidth and utilized
   bandwidth.

   Note that BANDWIDTH is specified in IEEE floating point format and express
   in Bytes/second.  Delays and delay variation are express in micro-second
   (Âµs). Loss is specified in PERCENTAGE ranging from 0 to 50.331642% by step
   of 0.000003.

.. clicmd:: neighbor <A.B.C.D> as (0-65535)

   Specifies the remote ASBR IP address and Autonomous System (AS) number
   for InterASv2 link in OSPF (RFC5392).  Note that this option is not yet
   supported for ISIS (RFC5316).

Nexthop Tracking
================

Nexthop tracking doesn't resolve nexthops via the default route by default.
Allowing this might be useful when e.g. you want to allow BGP to peer across
the default route.

.. clicmd:: ip nht resolve-via-default

   Allow IPv4 nexthop tracking to resolve via the default route. This parameter
   is configured per-VRF, so the command is also available in the VRF subnode.

.. clicmd:: ipv6 nht resolve-via-default

   Allow IPv6 nexthop tracking to resolve via the default route. This parameter
   is configured per-VRF, so the command is also available in the VRF subnode.

Administrative Distance
=======================

Administrative distance allows FRR to make decisions about what routes
should be installed in the rib based upon the originating protocol.
The lowest Admin Distance is the route selected.  This is purely a
subjective decision about ordering and care has been taken to choose
the same distances that other routing suites have choosen.

+------------+-----------+
| Protocol   | Distance  |
+------------+-----------+
| System     | 0         |
+------------+-----------+
| Kernel     | 0         |
+------------+-----------+
| Connect    | 0         |
+------------+-----------+
| Static     | 1         |
+------------+-----------+
| NHRP       | 10        |
+------------+-----------+
| EBGP       | 20        |
+------------+-----------+
| EIGRP      | 90        |
+------------+-----------+
| BABEL      | 100       |
+------------+-----------+
| OSPF       | 110       |
+------------+-----------+
| ISIS       | 115       |
+------------+-----------+
| OPENFABRIC | 115       |
+------------+-----------+
| RIP        | 120       |
+------------+-----------+
| Table      | 150       |
+------------+-----------+
| SHARP      | 150       |
+------------+-----------+
| IBGP       | 200       |
+------------+-----------+
| PBR        | 200       |
+------------+-----------+

An admin distance of 255 indicates to Zebra that the route should not be
installed into the Data Plane.  Additionally routes with an admin distance
of 255 will not be redistributed.

Zebra does treat Kernel routes as special case for the purposes of Admin
Distance.  Upon learning about a route that is not originated by FRR
we read the metric value as a uint32_t.  The top byte of the value
is interpreted as the Administrative Distance and the low three bytes
are read in as the metric.  This special case is to facilitate VRF
default routes.

Route Replace Semantics
=======================

When using the Linux Kernel as a forwarding plane, routes are installed
with a metric of 20 to the kernel.  Please note that the kernel's metric
value bears no resemblence to FRR's RIB metric or admin distance.  It
merely is a way for the Linux Kernel to decide which route to use if it
has multiple routes for the same prefix from multiple sources.  An example
here would be if someone else was running another routing suite besides
FRR at the same time, the kernel must choose what route to use to forward
on.  FRR choose the value of 20 because of two reasons.  FRR wanted a
value small enough to be choosen but large enough that the operator could
allow route prioritization by the kernel when multiple routing suites are
being run and FRR wanted to take advantage of Route Replace semantics that
the linux kernel offers.  In order for Route Replacement semantics to
work FRR must use the same metric when issuing the replace command.
Currently FRR only supports Route Replace semantics using the Linux
Kernel.

.. _zebra-vrf:

Virtual Routing and Forwarding
==============================

FRR supports :abbr:`VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)`. VRF is a way to
separate networking contexts on the same machine. Those networking contexts are
associated with separate interfaces, thus making it possible to associate one
interface with a specific VRF.

VRF can be used, for example, when instantiating per enterprise networking
services, without having to instantiate the physical host machine or the
routing management daemons for each enterprise. As a result, interfaces are
separate for each set of VRF, and routing daemons can have their own context
for each VRF.

This conceptual view introduces the *Default VRF* case. If the user does not
configure any specific VRF, then by default, FRR uses the *Default VRF*.

Configuring VRF networking contexts can be done in various ways on FRR. The VRF
interfaces can be configured by entering in interface configuration mode
:clicmd:`interface IFNAME vrf VRF`.

A VRF backend mode is chosen when running *Zebra*.

If no option is chosen, then the *Linux VRF* implementation as references in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt will be mapped over
the *Zebra* VRF. The routing table associated to that VRF is a Linux table
identifier located in the same *Linux network namespace* where *Zebra* started.
Please note when using the *Linux VRF* routing table it is expected that a
default Kernel route will be installed that has a metric as outlined in the
www.kernel.org doc above.  The Linux Kernel does table lookup via a combination
of rule application of the rule table and then route lookup of the specified
table.  If no route match is found then the next applicable rule is applied
to find the next route table to use to look for a route match.  As such if
your VRF table does not have a default blackhole route with a high metric
VRF route lookup will leave the table specified by the VRF, which is undesirable.

If the :option:`-n` option is chosen, then the *Linux network namespace* will
be mapped over the *Zebra* VRF. That implies that *Zebra* is able to configure
several *Linux network namespaces*.  The routing table associated to that VRF
is the whole routing tables located in that namespace. For instance, this mode
matches OpenStack Network Namespaces. It matches also OpenFastPath. The default
behavior remains Linux VRF which is supported by the Linux kernel community,
see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt.

Because of that difference, there are some subtle differences when running some
commands in relationship to VRF. Here is an extract of some of those commands:

.. clicmd:: vrf VRF

   This command is available on configuration mode. By default, above command
   permits accessing the VRF configuration mode. This mode is available for
   both VRFs. It is to be noted that *Zebra* does not create Linux VRF.
   The network administrator can however decide to provision this command in
   configuration file to provide more clarity about the intended configuration.

.. clicmd:: netns NAMESPACE

   This command is based on VRF configuration mode. This command is available
   when *Zebra* is run in :option:`-n` mode. This command reflects which *Linux
   network namespace* is to be mapped with *Zebra* VRF. It is to be noted that
   *Zebra* creates and detects added/suppressed VRFs from the Linux environment
   (in fact, those managed with iproute2). The network administrator can however
   decide to provision this command in configuration file to provide more clarity
   about the intended configuration.

.. clicmd:: show ip route vrf VRF

   The show command permits dumping the routing table associated to the VRF. If
   *Zebra* is launched with default settings, this will be the ``TABLENO`` of
   the VRF configured on the kernel, thanks to information provided in
   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt. If *Zebra* is
   launched with :option:`-n` option, this will be the default routing table of
   the *Linux network namespace* ``VRF``.

.. clicmd:: show ip route vrf VRF table TABLENO

   The show command is only available with :option:`-n` option. This command
   will dump the routing table ``TABLENO`` of the *Linux network namespace*
   ``VRF``.

.. clicmd:: show ip route vrf VRF tables

   This command will dump the routing tables within the vrf scope. If `vrf all`
   is executed, all routing tables will be dumped.

.. clicmd:: show <ip|ipv6> route summary [vrf VRF] [table TABLENO] [prefix]

   This command will dump a summary output of the specified VRF and TABLENO
   combination.  If neither VRF or TABLENO is specified FRR defaults to
   the default vrf and default table.  If prefix is specified dump the
   number of prefix routes.

By using the :option:`-n` option, the *Linux network namespace* will be mapped
over the *Zebra* VRF. One nice feature that is possible by handling *Linux
network namespace* is the ability to name default VRF. At startup, *Zebra*
discovers the available *Linux network namespace* by parsing folder
`/var/run/netns`. Each file stands for a *Linux network namespace*, but not all
*Linux network namespaces* are available under that folder. This is the case for
default VRF. It is possible to name the default VRF, by creating a file, by
executing following commands.

.. code-block:: shell

   touch /var/run/netns/vrf0
   mount --bind /proc/self/ns/net /var/run/netns/vrf0

Above command illustrates what happens when the default VRF is visible under
`var/run/netns/`. Here, the default VRF file is `vrf0`.
At startup, FRR detects the presence of that file. It detects that the file
statistics information matches the same file statistics information as
`/proc/self/ns/net` ( through stat() function). As statistics information
matches, then `vrf0` stands for the new default namespace name.
Consequently, the VRF naming `Default` will be overridden by the new discovered
namespace name `vrf0`.

For those who don't use VRF backend with *Linux network namespace*, it is
possible to statically configure and recompile FRR. It is possible to choose an
alternate name for default VRF. Then, the default VRF naming will automatically
be updated with the new name. To illustrate, if you want to recompile with
`global` value, use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./configure --with-defaultvrfname=global

.. _zebra-ecmp:

ECMP
====

FRR supports ECMP as part of normal operations and is generally compiled
with a limit of 64 way ECMP.  This of course can be modified via configure
options on compilation if the end operator desires to do so.  Individual
protocols each have their own way of dictating ECMP policy and their
respective documentation should be read.

ECMP can be inspected in zebra by doing a `show ip route X` command.

.. code-block:: shell

In this example we have 16 way ecmp for the 4.4.4.4/32 route.  The `*` character
tells us that the route is installed in the Data Plane, or FIB.

If you are using the Linux kernel as a Data Plane, this can be inspected
via a `ip route show X` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   sharpd@eva ~/f/doc(ecmp_doc_change)> ip route show 4.4.4.4/32

      nexthop via 192.168.161.4 dev enp39s0 weight 1
      nexthop via 192.168.161.5 dev enp39s0 weight 1
      nexthop via 192.168.161.6 dev enp39s0 weight 1
      nexthop via 192.168.161.7 dev enp39s0 weight 1
      nexthop via 192.168.161.8 dev enp39s0 weight 1
      nexthop via 192.168.161.9 dev enp39s0 weight 1

Once installed into the FIB, FRR currently has little control over what
nexthops are choosen to forward packets on.  Currently the Linux kernel
has a `fib_multipath_hash_policy` sysctl which dictates how the hashing
algorithm is used to forward packets.

.. _zebra-mpls:

MPLS Commands
=============

You can configure static mpls entries in zebra. Basically, handling MPLS
consists of popping, swapping or pushing labels to IP packets.

MPLS Acronyms
-------------

:abbr:`LSR (Labeled Switch Router)`
   Networking devices handling labels used to forward traffic between and through
   them.

:abbr:`LER (Labeled Edge Router)`
   A Labeled edge router is located at the edge of an MPLS network, generally
   between an IP network and an MPLS network.

MPLS Push Action
----------------

The push action is generally used for LER devices, which want to encapsulate
all traffic for a wished destination into an MPLS label. This action is stored
in routing entry, and can be configured like a route:

.. clicmd:: ip route NETWORK MASK GATEWAY|INTERFACE label LABEL

   NETWORK and MASK stand for the IP prefix entry to be added as static
   route entry.
   GATEWAY is the gateway IP address to reach, in order to reach the prefix.
   INTERFACE is the interface behind which the prefix is located.
   LABEL is the MPLS label to use to reach the prefix abovementioned.

   You can check that the static entry is stored in the zebra RIB database, by
   looking at the presence of the entry.

   ::

      zebra(configure)# ip route 1.1.1.1/32 10.0.1.1 label 777
      zebra# show ip route
      Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
      O - OSPF, I - IS-IS, B - BGP, E - EIGRP, N - NHRP,
      T - Table, v - VNC, V - VNC-Direct, A - Babel, D - SHARP,
      F - PBR,
      > - selected route, * - FIB route

      S>* 1.1.1.1/32 [1/0] via 10.0.1.1, r2-eth0, label 777, 00:39:42

MPLS Swap and Pop Action
------------------------

The swap action is generally used for LSR devices, which swap a packet with a
label, with an other label. The Pop action is used on LER devices, at the
termination of the MPLS traffic; this is used to remove MPLS header.

.. clicmd:: mpls lsp INCOMING_LABEL GATEWAY OUTGOING_LABEL|explicit-null|implicit-null

   INCOMING_LABEL and OUTGOING_LABEL are MPLS labels with values ranging from 16
   to 1048575.
   GATEWAY is the gateway IP address where to send MPLS packet.
   The outgoing label can either be a value or have an explicit-null label header. This
   specific header can be read by IP devices. The incoming label can also be removed; in
   that case the implicit-null keyword is used, and the outgoing packet emitted is an IP
   packet without MPLS header.

You can check that the MPLS actions are stored in the zebra MPLS table, by looking at the
presence of the entry.

.. clicmd:: show mpls table

::

   zebra(configure)# mpls lsp 18 10.125.0.2 implicit-null
   zebra(configure)# mpls lsp 19 10.125.0.2 20

.. _zebra-srv6:

Segment-Routing SRv6
====================

Segment-Routing is source routing paradigm that allows
network operator to encode network intent into the packets.
SRv6 is an implementation of Segment-Routing
with application of IPv6 and segment-routing-header.

All routing daemon can use the Segment-Routing base
framework implemented on zebra to use SRv6 routing mechanism.
In that case, user must configure initial srv6 setting on
FRR's cli or frr.conf or zebra.conf. This section shows how
to configure SRv6 on FRR. Of course SRv6 can be used as standalone,
and this section also helps that case.

.. index:: show segment-routing srv6 locator [json]
.. clicmd:: show segment-routing srv6 locator [json]

   This command dump SRv6-locator configured on zebra.
   SRv6-locator is used to route to the node before performing
   the SRv6-function. and that works as aggregation of
   SRv6-function's IDs.
   Following console log shows two SRv6-locators LOC1 and LOC2.
   All locators are identified by unique IPv6 prefix.
   User can get that information as JSON string when ``json``
   key word at the end of cli is presented.

::

   router# sh segment-routing srv6 locator
   Locator:
   Name                 ID      Prefix                   Status
   -------------------- ------- ------------------------ -------
   hoge                       1 1::/64                   Up
   fuga                       2 2::/64                   Up

.. index:: segment-routing
.. clicmd:: segment-routing
.. index:: srv6
.. clicmd:: srv6
.. index:: locators
.. clicmd:: locators

   User can enter the SRv6 configuration node with ``segment-routing`` and
   ``srv6`` commands in configure mode. If there is some SRv6-locator exist,
   SRv6 feature is looked enabled and this affects running-config.

   User can enter the Locators node with ``locators`` command
   in srv6 configure mode.
   After entering locators node, user can configure one or multi SRv6-locators.

.. index:: locator NAME
.. clicmd:: locator NAME
.. index:: prefix X:X::X:X/M [function-bits-length 32]
.. clicmd:: prefix X:X::X:X/M [function-bits-length 32]

   Following example console log shows the typical configuration of
   SRv6 data-plane. After a new SRv6 locator, named LOC1, is created,
   LOC1's prefix is configured as ``2001:db8:a:a::/64``.

   If user or some routing daemon allocates new SID on this locator,
   new SID will allocated in range of this prefix.

   For example, if some routing daemon creates new SID on locator
   (``2001:db8:a:a::/64``), Then new SID will be
   ``2001:db8:a:a:7::/80``, ``2001:db8:a:a:8::/80``, and so on.

   Each locator has default SID that is SRv6 local function "End".
   Usually default SID is allocated as ``PREFIX:1::``.
   (``PREFIX`` is locator's prefix)
   For example, if user configure the locator's prefix as
   ``2001:db8:a:a::/64``, then default SID will be ``2001:db8:a:a:1::``)

   The function bits range is 16bits by default.
   If operator want to change function bits range, they can configure
   with ``function-bits-length`` option.

.. _multicast-rib-commands:

Multicast RIB Commands
======================

The Multicast RIB provides a separate table of unicast destinations which
is used for Multicast Reverse Path Forwarding decisions. It is used with
a multicast source's IP address, hence contains not multicast group
addresses but unicast addresses.

This table is fully separate from the default unicast table. However,
RPF lookup can include the unicast table.

WARNING: RPF lookup results are non-responsive in this version of FRR,
i.e. multicast routing does not actively react to changes in underlying
unicast topology!

.. clicmd:: ip multicast rpf-lookup-mode MODE


   MODE sets the method used to perform RPF lookups. Supported modes:

   urib-only
      Performs the lookup on the Unicast RIB. The Multicast RIB is never used.

   mrib-only
      Performs the lookup on the Multicast RIB. The Unicast RIB is never used.

   mrib-then-urib
      Tries to perform the lookup on the Multicast RIB. If any route is found,
      that route is used. Otherwise, the Unicast RIB is tried.

   lower-distance
      Performs a lookup on the Multicast RIB and Unicast RIB each. The result
      with the lower administrative distance is used;  if they're equal, the
      Multicast RIB takes precedence.

   longer-prefix
      Performs a lookup on the Multicast RIB and Unicast RIB each. The result
      with the longer prefix length is used;  if they're equal, the
      Multicast RIB takes precedence.

      The `mrib-then-urib` setting is the default behavior if nothing is
      configured. If this is the desired behavior, it should be explicitly
      configured to make the configuration immune against possible changes in
      what the default behavior is.

.. warning::

   Unreachable routes do not receive special treatment and do not cause
   fallback to a second lookup.

.. clicmd:: show ip rpf ADDR

   Performs a Multicast RPF lookup, as configured with ``ip multicast
   rpf-lookup-mode MODE``. ADDR specifies the multicast source address to look
   up.

   ::

      > show ip rpf 192.0.2.1
      Routing entry for 192.0.2.0/24 using Unicast RIB

      Known via "kernel", distance 0, metric 0, best
      * 198.51.100.1, via eth0


   Indicates that a multicast source lookup for 192.0.2.1 would use an
   Unicast RIB entry for 192.0.2.0/24 with a gateway of 198.51.100.1.

.. clicmd:: show ip rpf

   Prints the entire Multicast RIB. Note that this is independent of the
   configured RPF lookup mode, the Multicast RIB may be printed yet not
   used at all.

.. clicmd:: ip mroute PREFIX NEXTHOP [DISTANCE]


   Adds a static route entry to the Multicast RIB. This performs exactly as the
   ``ip route`` command, except that it inserts the route in the Multicast RIB
   instead of the Unicast RIB.

.. _zebra-route-filtering:

zebra Route Filtering
=====================

Zebra supports :dfn:`prefix-list` s and :ref:`route-map` s to match routes
received from other FRR components. The permit/deny facilities provided by
these commands can be used to filter which routes zebra will install in the
kernel.

.. clicmd:: ip protocol PROTOCOL route-map ROUTEMAP

   Apply a route-map filter to routes for the specified protocol. PROTOCOL can
   be:

   - any,
   - babel,
   - bgp,
   - connected,
   - eigrp,
   - isis,
   - kernel,
   - nhrp,
   - openfabric,
   - ospf,
   - ospf6,
   - rip,
   - sharp,
   - static,
   - ripng,
   - table,
   - vnc.

   If you choose any as the option that will cause all protocols that are sending
   routes to zebra.  You can specify a :dfn:`ip protocol PROTOCOL route-map ROUTEMAP`
   on a per vrf basis, by entering this command under vrf mode for the vrf you
   want to apply the route-map against.

.. clicmd:: set src ADDRESS

   Within a route-map, set the preferred source address for matching routes
   when installing in the kernel.


The following creates a prefix-list that matches all addresses, a route-map
that sets the preferred source address, and applies the route-map to all
*rip* routes.

.. code-block:: frr

   ip prefix-list ANY permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
   route-map RM1 permit 10
        match ip address prefix-list ANY
        set src 10.0.0.1

   ip protocol rip route-map RM1

IPv6 example for OSPFv3.

.. code-block:: frr

   ipv6 prefix-list ANY seq 10 permit any
   route-map RM6 permit 10
       match ipv6 address prefix-list ANY
       set src 2001:db8:425:1000::3

   ipv6 protocol ospf6 route-map RM6


.. note::

   For both IPv4 and IPv6, the IP address has to exist at the point the
   route-map is created.  Be wary of race conditions if the interface is
   not created at startup.  On Debian, FRR might start before ifupdown
   completes. Consider a reboot test.

.. clicmd:: zebra route-map delay-timer (0-600)

   Set the delay before any route-maps are processed in zebra.  The
   default time for this is 5 seconds.

.. _zebra-fib-push-interface:

zebra FIB push interface
========================

Zebra supports a 'FIB push' interface that allows an external
component to learn the forwarding information computed by the FRR
routing suite. This is a loadable module that needs to be enabled
at startup as described in :ref:`loadable-module-support`.

In FRR, the Routing Information Base (RIB) resides inside
zebra. Routing protocols communicate their best routes to zebra, and
zebra computes the best route across protocols for each prefix. This
latter information makes up the Forwarding Information Base
(FIB). Zebra feeds the FIB to the kernel, which allows the IP stack in
the kernel to forward packets according to the routes computed by
FRR. The kernel FIB is updated in an OS-specific way. For example,
the `Netlink` interface is used on Linux, and route sockets are
used on FreeBSD.

The FIB push interface aims to provide a cross-platform mechanism to
support scenarios where the router has a forwarding path that is
distinct from the kernel, commonly a hardware-based fast path. In
these cases, the FIB needs to be maintained reliably in the fast path
as well. We refer to the component that programs the forwarding plane
(directly or indirectly) as the Forwarding Plane Manager or FPM.

.. program:: configure

The relevant zebra code kicks in when zebra is configured with the
:option:`--enable-fpm` flag and started with the module (``-M fpm``
or ``-M dplane_fpm_nl``).

.. note::

   The ``fpm`` implementation attempts to connect to ``127.0.0.1`` port ``2620``
   by default without configurations. The ``dplane_fpm_nl`` only attempts to
   connect to a server if configured.

Zebra periodically attempts to connect to the well-known FPM port (``2620``).
Once the connection is up, zebra starts sending messages containing routes
over the socket to the FPM. Zebra sends a complete copy of the forwarding
table to the FPM, including routes that it may have picked up from the kernel.
The existing interaction of zebra with the kernel remains unchanged -- that
is, the kernel continues to receive FIB updates as before.

The default FPM message format is netlink, however it can be controlled
with the module load-time option. The modules accept the following options:

- ``fpm``: ``netlink`` and ``protobuf``.
- ``dplane_fpm_nl``: none, it only implements netlink.

The zebra FPM interface uses replace semantics. That is, if a 'route
add' message for a prefix is followed by another 'route add' message,
the information in the second message is complete by itself, and
replaces the information sent in the first message.

If the connection to the FPM goes down for some reason, zebra sends
the FPM a complete copy of the forwarding table(s) when it reconnects.

For more details on the implementation, please read the developer's manual FPM
section.

FPM Commands

.. clicmd:: fpm connection ip A.B.C.D port (1-65535)

   Configure ``zebra`` to connect to a different FPM server than the default of
   ``127.0.0.1:2060``

.. clicmd:: show zebra fpm stats

   Shows the FPM statistics.

   connections and will not attempt to connect to it anymore.

.. clicmd:: fpm use-next-hop-groups

   Use the new netlink messages ``RTM_NEWNEXTHOP`` / ``RTM_DELNEXTHOP`` to
   group repeated route next hop information.

   The ``no`` form uses the old known FPM behavior of including next hop
   information in the route (e.g. ``RTM_NEWROUTE``) messages.

.. _zebra-dplane:

Dataplane Commands
==================

The zebra dataplane subsystem provides a framework for FIB
programming. Zebra uses the dataplane to program the local kernel as
it makes changes to objects such as IP routes, MPLS LSPs, and
interface IP addresses. The dataplane runs in its own pthread, in
order to off-load work from the main zebra pthread.


.. clicmd:: show zebra dplane [detailed]

   Display statistics about the updates and events passing through the
   dataplane subsystem.


.. clicmd:: show zebra dplane providers

   Display information about the running dataplane plugins that are
   providing updates to a FIB. By default, the local kernel plugin is
   present.


.. clicmd:: zebra dplane limit [NUMBER]

   Configure the limit on the number of pending updates that are
   waiting to be processed by the dataplane pthread.


zebra Terminal Mode Commands
============================

.. clicmd:: show ip route

   Display current routes which zebra holds in its database.

::

    Router# show ip route
    Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
     B - BGP * - FIB route.

    K* 0.0.0.0/0        203.181.89.241

    C* 127.0.0.0/8      lo
    C* 203.181.89.240/28      eth0


.. clicmd:: show ipv6 route

.. clicmd:: show [ip|ipv6] route [PREFIX] [nexthop-group]

   Display detailed information about a route. If [nexthop-group] is
   included, it will display the nexthop group ID the route is using as well.

.. clicmd:: show interface [NAME] [{vrf VRF|brief}] [nexthop-group]

.. clicmd:: show interface [NAME] [{vrf all|brief}] [nexthop-group]

   Display interface information. If no extra information is added, it will
   dump information on all interfaces. If [NAME] is specified, it will display
   detailed information about that single interface. If [nexthop-group] is
   specified, it will display nexthop groups pointing out that interface.

.. clicmd:: show ip prefix-list [NAME]

.. clicmd:: show route-map [NAME]

.. clicmd:: show ip protocol

.. clicmd:: show ip forward

   Display whether the host's IP forwarding function is enabled or not.
   Almost any UNIX kernel can be configured with IP forwarding disabled.
   If so, the box can't work as a router.

.. clicmd:: show ipv6 forward

   Display whether the host's IP v6 forwarding is enabled or not.

.. clicmd:: show zebra

   Display various statistics related to the installation and deletion
   of routes, neighbor updates, and LSP's into the kernel.

.. clicmd:: show zebra client [summary]

   Display statistics about clients that are connected to zebra.  This is
   useful for debugging and seeing how much data is being passed between
   zebra and it's clients.  If the summary form of the command is choosen
   a table is displayed with shortened information.

.. clicmd:: show zebra router table summary

   Display summarized data about tables created, their afi/safi/tableid
   and how many routes each table contains.  Please note this is the
   total number of route nodes in the table.  Which will be higher than
   the actual number of routes that are held.

.. clicmd:: show nexthop-group rib [ID] [vrf NAME] [singleton [ip|ip6]] [type]

   Display nexthop groups created by zebra.  The [vrf NAME] option
   is only meaningful if you have started zebra with the --vrfwnetns
   option as that nexthop groups are per namespace in linux.
   If you specify singleton you would like to see the singleton
   nexthop groups that do have an afi. [type] allows you to filter those
   only coming from a specific NHG type (protocol).

.. clicmd:: show <ip|ipv6> zebra route dump [<vrf> VRFNAME]

   It dumps all the routes from RIB with detailed information including
   internal flags, status etc. This is defined as a hidden command.


Router-id
=========

Many routing protocols require a router-id to be configured. To have a
consistent router-id across all daemons, the following commands are available
to configure and display the router-id:

.. clicmd:: [ip] router-id A.B.C.D

   Allow entering of the router-id.  This command also works under the
   vrf subnode, to allow router-id's per vrf.

.. clicmd:: [ip] router-id A.B.C.D vrf NAME

   Configure the router-id of this router from the configure NODE.
   A show run of this command will display the router-id command
   under the vrf sub node.  This command is deprecated and will
   be removed at some point in time in the future.

.. clicmd:: show [ip] router-id [vrf NAME]

   Display the user configured router-id.

For protocols requiring an IPv6 router-id, the following commands are available:

.. clicmd:: ipv6 router-id X:X::X:X

   Configure the IPv6 router-id of this router. Like its IPv4 counterpart,
   this command works under the vrf subnode, to allow router-id's per vrf.

.. clicmd:: show ipv6 router-id [vrf NAME]

   Display the user configured IPv6 router-id.

Expected sysctl settings
========================

The linux kernel has a variety of sysctl's that affect it's operation as a router.  This
section is meant to act as a starting point for those sysctl's that must be used in
order to provide FRR with smooth operation as a router.  This section is not meant
as the full documentation for sysctl's.  The operator must use the sysctl documentation
with the linux kernel for that.

.. option:: net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

   This option allows the linux kernel to forward ipv4 packets incoming from one interface
   to an outgoing interface.  Without this no forwarding will take place from off box packets.

.. option:: net.ipv6.conf.all_forwarding=1

   This option allows the linux kernel to forward ipv6 packets incoming from one interface
   to an outgoing interface.  Without this no forwarding will take place from off box packets.

.. option:: net.ipv6.conf.all.keep_addr_on_down=1

   When an interface is taken down, do not remove the v6 addresses associated with the interface.
   This option is recommended because this is the default behavior for v4 as well.

.. option:: net.ipv6.route.skip_notify_on_dev_down=1

   When an interface is taken down, the linux kernel will not notify, via netlink, about routes
   that used that interface being removed from the FIB.  This option is recommended because this
   is the default behavior for v4 as well.

Debugging
