FRRouting User Guide
====================

FRR is a fully featured, high performance, free software IP routing suite.  It
implements all standard routing protocols such as BGP, RIP, OSPF, IS-IS and
more (see :ref:`feature-matrix`), as well as many of their extensions. It can
handle full Internet routing tables and is suitable for use on hardware ranging
from cheap SBCs to commercial grade routers, and is actively used in production
by hundreds of companies, universities, research labs and governments.

FRR runs on all modern \*NIX operating systems, including Linux and the BSDs.
Feature support varies by platform; see the :ref:`feature-matrix`.

FRR is distributed under GPLv2, with development modeled after the Linux
kernel. Anyone may contribute features, bug fixes, tools, documentation
updates, or anything else.

FRR is a fork of `Quagga <http://www.quagga.net/>`_.
