ISIS
****

:abbr:`ISIS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)` is a routing protocol
which is described in :t:`ISO10589`, :rfc:`1195`, :rfc:`5308`. ISIS is an
:abbr:`IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)`. Compared with :abbr:`RIP`,
:abbr:`ISIS` can provide scalable network support and faster convergence times
like :abbr:`OSPF`. ISIS is widely used in large networks such as :abbr:`ISP
(Internet Service Provider)` and carrier backbone networks.

.. _configuring-isisd:

Configuring isisd
=================

There are no *isisd* specific options. Common options can be specified
(:ref:`common-invocation-options`) to *isisd*. *isisd* needs to acquire
interface information from *zebra* in order to function. Therefore *zebra* must
be running before invoking *isisd*. Also, if *zebra* is restarted then *isisd*
must be too.

Like other daemons, *isisd* configuration is done in :abbr:`ISIS` specific
configuration file :file:`isisd.conf`.

.. _isis-router:

ISIS router
===========

To start the ISIS process you have to specify the ISIS router. As of this
writing, *isisd* does not support multiple ISIS processes.

.. clicmd:: router isis WORD [vrf NAME]

   Enable or disable the ISIS process by specifying the ISIS domain with
   'WORD'.  *isisd* does not yet support multiple ISIS processes but you must
   specify the name of ISIS process. The ISIS process name 'WORD' is then used
   for interface (see command :clicmd:`ip router isis WORD`).

   (Extended Metric) with or without Multi-Topology. All Traffic Engineering
   information are stored in a database formally named TED. However, best
   acccuracy is provided without Multi-Topology due to inconsistency of Traffic
   Engineering Advertisement of 3rd party commercial routers when MT is enabled.

.. _isis-segment-routing:

Segment Routing
===============

This is an EXPERIMENTAL support of Segment Routing as per RFC8667
for MPLS dataplane. It supports IPv4, IPv6 and ECMP and has been
tested against Cisco & Juniper routers.

Known limitations:
 - No support for level redistribution (L1 to L2 or L2 to L1)
 - No support for binding SID
 - No support for SRMS
 - No support for SRLB
 - Only one SRGB and default SPF Algorithm is supported

.. clicmd:: segment-routing on

   Enable Segment Routing.

.. clicmd:: segment-routing global-block (16-1048575) (16-1048575) [local-block (16-1048575) (16-1048575)]

   Set the Segment Routing Global Block i.e. the label range used by MPLS
   to store label in the MPLS FIB for Prefix SID. Note that the block size
   may not exceed 65535. Optionally sets also the Segment Routing Local Block.
   The negative command always unsets both.

.. clicmd:: segment-routing node-msd (1-16)

   Set the Maximum Stack Depth supported by the router. The value depend of the
   MPLS dataplane. E.g. for Linux kernel, since version 4.13 the maximum value
   is 32.

.. clicmd:: segment-routing prefix <A.B.C.D/M|X:X::X:X/M> [algorithm (128-255)] <absolute (16-1048575)|index (0-65535) [no-php-flag|explicit-null] [n-flag-clear]

   prefix. The 'no-php-flag' means NO Penultimate Hop Popping that allows SR
   node to request to its neighbor to not pop the label. The 'explicit-null'
   flag allows SR node to request to its neighbor to send IP packet with the
   EXPLICIT-NULL label. The 'n-flag-clear' option can be used to explicitly
   clear the Node flag that is set by default for Prefix-SIDs associated to
   loopback addresses. This option is necessary to configure Anycast-SIDs.

.. clicmd:: show isis segment-routing node [algorithm (128-255)]

   Show detailed information about all learned Segment Routing Nodes.

.. _isis-flex-algo:

Flex-Algos (Flex-Algo)
======================

*isisd* supports some features of
`RFC 9350 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9350>`_ on an MPLS Segment-Routing
dataplane. The compatibility has been tested against Cisco.

IS-IS uses by default the `Shortest-Path-First` algorithm that basically
calculates paths based on the shortest total metric to the destinations.
Flex-Algo allows new algorithms to run in parallel to compute paths in different
manners, based on metrics (IGP metric or a new type of metrics such as Traffic
Engineering (TE) metric and minimum delay...) and constraints. New metric types
are not yet implemented but constraints are already operational. Constraints can
restrict paths to links with specific affinities or avoid links with specific
affinities. Combinations of these are also possible.

The administrator can configure up to 128 Flex-Algos in an IS-IS area.
To do so, it defines a set of Flex-Algo Definitions (FAD) which
have the following characteristics:

- a numeric identifier (ID) between 128 and 255 inclusive
- a set of constraints (basically, include or exclude a certain given set of
	links, designated by a admin-group)
- the calculation type (only the `Shortest-Path-First` is currently supported)
- the metric type (only the IGP inherited metric type is currently supported)
- some additional flags (not supported for the moment).

A subset of routers advertises the Flex-Algo Definitions (FAD) to the other
routers within an area. In order to use a common set of FADs, each router runs a
FAD election process for each locally configured algorithm, using the following
rules:

- If a locally configured FAD is not advertised to the area, the router does not
	participate in the particular flex algorithm.
- If a given flex algorithm is running, the participation in this particular
	flex algorithm stops when its advertisements are over.
- A router includes its own FAD in the election process if and only if it is
	advertised to the other routers.
- If only one router advertises the FAD, the FAD is elected.
- If several FADs are advertised with different priorities, the one with the
	highest priority value is selected.
- If there are multiple advertisements of the FAD with the same highest
	priority, the FAD of the router with the highest IS-IS system-ID is
	selected.

Routers only use the specifications of the elected FAD regardless of the locally
configured definitions. If a router does not support one of the FAD
characteristics, it stops participating in the Flex-Algo.

For each running Flex-Algo, the Segment-Routing SIDs must be
configured with values unique to the algorithm. It allows routers to identify
which flex algorithm they must use for a given packet.

The following commands configure Flex-Algo at the 'router isis' configuration
level. Segment-Routing prefixes must be configured for the Flex-Algo.

.. clicmd:: flexible-algorithm (128-255)

   Add a Flex-Algo Definition (FAD) and enter the FAD configuration
   level. The algorithm ID value is in the range of 128 to 255 inclusive.

.. clicmd:: no flexible-algorithm (128-255)

   Unconfigure a Flex-Algo Definition.

.. clicmd:: affinity-map NAME bit-position (0-255)

   Add the specified 'affinity-map'. Affinity-map definitions are used in
   FADs and in interfaces admin-group definition.

   Affinity-maps format in advertisement TLVs use the extended admin-group
   format defined in the RFC7308 section 2.2. The extended admin-group uses a
   256 bits field. If an affinity-map is set, the bit at the extended
   admin-group 'bit-position' is set 1, else it is set to 0.

The following commands configure Flex-Algo at the 'router isis' and
'flexible-algorithm (128-255)' configuration level.

.. clicmd:: advertise-definition

   Advertise the current FAD to other IS-IS routers by using specific IS-IS
   TLVs. By default, the definition is is not shared with other routers.

   A router can advertise a FAD without participating in the Flex-Algo.

.. clicmd:: priority (0-255)

   Set the specified 'priority' in the current FAD advertisements .

.. clicmd:: metric-type [igp|te|delay]

   Set the 'metric-type' for the current FAD. 'igp' is
   the default value and refers to the classic 'Shortest-Path-First' algorithm.
   If the 'te' or the 'delay' metric is selected, the value is advertised but
   the flex algorithm is disabled locally because these types are not currently
   supported.

.. clicmd:: no metric-type

   Reset the 'metric-type' to the default 'igp' metric.

.. clicmd:: affinity exclude-any NAME

   Add the specified affinity to the list of exclude-any affinities. The
   Flex-Algo will compute paths that exclude the segments with any of
   the specified affinities.

.. clicmd:: no affinity exclude-any NAME

   Remove the specified affinity to the list of exclude-any affinities.

.. clicmd:: affinity include-all NAME

   Add the specified affinity to the list of include-all affinities. The
   Flex-Algo will compute paths that include the segments with all
   the specified affinities.

.. clicmd:: no affinity include-all NAME

   Remove the specified affinity to the list of include-all affinities.

.. clicmd:: affinity include-any NAME

   Add the specified affinity to the list of include-any affinities. The
   Flex-Algo will compute paths that include the segments with any of
   the specified affinities.

.. clicmd:: no affinity include-any NAME

   Remove the specified affinity to the list of include-any affinities.

The following commands configure Flex-Algo at the 'interface' configuration
level.

.. clicmd:: isis affinity flex-algo NAME

	Add the specified affinity to the interface.

.. clicmd:: no isis affinity flex-algo NAME

	Remove the specified affinity from the interface.

The following command show Flex-Algo information:

.. clicmd:: show isis flex-algo [(128-255)]

	Show information about the elected FADs

'show isis route', 'show isis topology' and 'show isis segment-routing node'
includes an 'algorithm (128-255)' optional argument. See
:ref:`showing-isis-information` and :ref:`isis-segment-routing`.
