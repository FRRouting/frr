OSPFv3
******

*ospf6d* is a daemon support OSPF version 3 for IPv6 network. OSPF for IPv6 is
described in :rfc:`2740`.

.. _ospf6-router:

OSPF6 router
============

.. clicmd:: router ospf6 [vrf NAME]

.. clicmd:: ospf6 router-id A.B.C.D

   Set router's Router-ID.

.. clicmd:: timers throttle spf (0-600000) (0-600000) (0-600000)

   This command sets the initial `delay`, the `initial-holdtime`
   and the `maximum-holdtime` between when SPF is calculated and the
   event which triggered the calculation. The times are specified in
   milliseconds and must be in the range of 0 to 600000 milliseconds.

   The `delay` specifies the minimum amount of time to delay SPF
   calculation (hence it affects how long SPF calculation is delayed after
   an event which occurs outside of the holdtime of any previous SPF
   calculation, and also serves as a minimum holdtime).

   Consecutive SPF calculations will always be separated by at least
   'hold-time' milliseconds. The hold-time is adaptive and initially is
   set to the `initial-holdtime` configured with the above command.
   Events which occur within the holdtime of the previous SPF calculation
   will cause the holdtime to be increased by `initial-holdtime`, bounded
   by the `maximum-holdtime` configured with this command. If the adaptive
   hold-time elapses without any SPF-triggering event occurring then
   the current holdtime is reset to the `initial-holdtime`.

   .. code-block:: frr

      router ospf6
       timers throttle spf 200 400 10000


   In this example, the `delay` is set to 200ms, the initial holdtime is set
   to 400ms and the `maximum holdtime` to 10s. Hence there will always be at
   least 200ms between an event which requires SPF calculation and the actual
   SPF calculation. Further consecutive SPF calculations will always be
   separated by between 400ms to 10s, the hold-time increasing by 400ms each
   time an SPF-triggering event occurs within the hold-time of the previous
   SPF calculation.

.. clicmd:: auto-cost reference-bandwidth COST


   This sets the reference bandwidth for cost calculations, where this
   bandwidth is considered equivalent to an OSPF cost of 1, specified in
   Mbits/s. The default is 100Mbit/s (i.e. a link of bandwidth 100Mbit/s
   or higher will have a cost of 1. Cost of lower bandwidth links will be
   scaled with reference to this cost).

   This configuration setting MUST be consistent across all routers
   within the OSPF domain.

.. clicmd:: maximum-paths (1-64)

   Use this command to control the maximum number of parallel routes that
   OSPFv3 can support. The default is 64.

.. clicmd:: write-multiplier (1-100)

   Use this command to tune the amount of work done in the packet read and
   write threads before relinquishing control. The parameter is the number
   of packets to process before returning. The default value of this parameter
   is 20.

.. clicmd:: clear ipv6 ospf6 process [vrf NAME]

   This command clears up the database and routing tables and resets the
   neighborship by restarting the interface state machine. This will be
   helpful when there is a change in router-id and if user wants the router-id
   change to take effect, user can use this cli instead of restarting the
   ospf6d daemon.

ASBR Summarisation Support in OSPFv3
====================================

   External routes in OSPFv3 are carried by type 5/7 LSA (external LSAs).
   External LSAs are generated by ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router).
   Large topology database requires a large amount of router memory, which
   slows down all processes, including SPF calculations.
   It is necessary to reduce the size of the OSPFv3 topology database,
   especially in a large network. Summarising routes keeps the routing
   tables smaller and easier to troubleshoot.

   External route summarization must be configured on ASBR.
   Stub area do not allow ASBR because they don’t allow type 5 LSAs.

   An ASBR will inject a summary route into the OSPFv3 domain.

   Summary route will only be advertised if you have at least one subnet
   that falls within the summary range.

   Users will be allowed an option in the CLI to not advertise range of
   ipv6 prefixes as well.

   The configuration of ASBR Summarisation is supported using the CLI command

.. clicmd:: summary-address X:X::X:X/M [tag (1-4294967295)] [{metric (0-16777215) | metric-type (1-2)}]

   This command will advertise a single External LSA on behalf of all the
   prefixes falling under this range configured by the CLI.
   The user is allowed to configure tag, metric and metric-type as well.
   By default, tag is not configured, default metric as 20 and metric-type
   as type-2 gets advertised.
   A summary route is created when one or more specific routes are learned and
   removed when no more specific route exist.
   The summary route is also installed in the local system with Null0 as
   next-hop to avoid leaking traffic.

.. clicmd:: no summary-address X:X::X:X/M [tag (1-4294967295)] [{metric (0-16777215) | metric-type (1-2)}]

   This command can be used to remove the summarisation configuration.
   This will flush the single External LSA if it was originated and advertise
   the External LSAs for all the existing individual prefixes.

.. clicmd:: summary-address X:X::X:X/M no-advertise

   This command can be used when user do not want to advertise a certain
   range of prefixes using the no-advertise option.
   This command when configured will flush all the existing external LSAs
   falling under this range.

.. clicmd:: no summary-address X:X::X:X/M no-advertise

   This command can be used to remove the previous configuration.
   When configured, tt will resume originating external LSAs for all the prefixes
   falling under the configured range.

.. clicmd:: aggregation timer (5-1800)

   The summarisation command takes effect after the aggregation timer expires.
   By default the value of this timer is 5 seconds. User can modify the time
   after which the external LSAs should get originated using this command.

.. clicmd:: no aggregation timer (5-1800)

   This command removes the timer configuration. It reverts back to default
   5 second timer.

.. clicmd:: show ipv6 ospf6 summary-address [detail] [json]

   This command can be used to see all the summary-address related information.
   When detail option is used, it shows all the prefixes falling under each
   summary-configuration apart from other information.

.. clicmd:: debug ospf6 lsa aggregation

   This command can be used to enable the debugs related to the summarisation
   of these LSAs.

.. _ospf6-area:

OSPF6 area
==========

.. clicmd:: area A.B.C.D nssa

NSSA Support in OSPFv3
=======================

The configuration of NSSA areas in OSPFv3 is supported using the CLI command
``area A.B.C.D nssa`` in ospf6 router configuration mode.
The following functionalities are implemented as per RFC 3101:

1. Advertising Type-7 LSA into NSSA area when external route is redistributed
   into OSPFv3
2. Processing Type-7 LSA received from neighbor and installing route in the
   route table
3. Support for NSSA ABR functionality which is generating Type-5 LSA when
   backbone area is configured. Currently translation of Type-7 LSA to Type-5 LSA
   is enabled by default.
4. Support for NSSA Translator functionality when there are multiple NSSA ABR
   in an area

   This command displays the ospfv3 routing table as determined by the most
   recent SPF calculations. Options are provided to view the different types
   of routes. Other than the standard view there are two other options, detail
   and summary. JSON output can be obtained by appending 'json' to the end of
   command.

.. clicmd:: show ipv6 ospf6 [vrf <NAME|all>] route X:X::X:X/M match [detail] [json]

   The additional match option will match the given address to the destination
   of the routes, and return the result accordingly.

   Interface name can also be given. JSON output can be obtained by appending
   'json' to the end of command.

.. clicmd:: show ipv6 ospf6 [vrf <NAME|all>] spf tree [json]

   This commands shows the spf tree from the recent spf calculation with the
   calling router as the root. If json is appended in the end, we can get the
   tree in JSON format. Each area that the router belongs to has it's own
   JSON object, with each router having "cost", "isLeafNode" and "children" as
   arguments.
