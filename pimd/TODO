    A Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM

T2  If an interface changes one of its secondary IP addresses, a Hello
    message with an updated Address_List option and a non-zero
    HoldTime should be sent immediately.

T5  PIM Neighbor Reduction
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wijnands-pim-neighbor-reduction/
    
    "In a transit LAN (no directly connected source or receiver), many
    of the PIM procedures don't apply. (...) This proposal describes
    a procedure to reduce the amount of neighbors established over a
    transit LAN."

T6  Single Stream Multicast Fast Reroute (SMFR) Method
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-pim-single-stream-multicast-frr/

    "This document proposes an IP multicast fast convergence method
    based on differentiating primary and backup PIM join."

T7  RFC5384 - The Join Attribute Format
    "This document describes a modification of the Join message that
    allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree."

T8  PIM Multi-Topology ID (MT-ID) Join-Attribute
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cai-pim-mtid-00
    Depends on T7.

    "This draft introduces a new type of PIM Join Attribute used to
    encode the identity of the topology PIM uses for RPF."
