  qpim_channel_oil_list holds a list of struct channel_oil.

  Each channel_oil.oil is used to control an (S,G) entry in the Kernel
  Multicast Forwarding Cache.

  There is a case when we create a channel_oil but don't install in the kernel

  Case where (S, G) entry not installed in the kernel:
    FRR receives IGMP/PIM (*, G) join and RP is not configured or
    not-reachable, then create a channel_oil for the group G with the incoming
    interface(channel_oil.oil.mfcc_parent) as invalid i.e "MAXVIF" and populate
    the outgoing interface where join is received. Keep this entry in the stack,
    but don't install in the kernel(channel_oil.installed = 0).

  Case where (S, G) entry installed in the kernel:
    When RP is configured and is reachable for the group G, and receiving a
    join if channel_oil is already present then populate the incoming interface
    and install the entry in the kernel, if channel_oil not present, then create
    a new_channel oil(channel_oil.installed = 1).

  is_valid: indicate if this entry is valid to get installed in kernel.
  installed: indicate if this entry is installed in the kernel.
