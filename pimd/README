INTRODUCTION

        qpimd aims to implement a PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)
	daemon for the FRR Routing Suite.

	qpimd implements PIM-SM (Sparse Mode) of RFC 4601.
        Additionally MSDP has been implemented.

	In order to deliver end-to-end multicast routing control
	plane, qpimd includes the router-side of IGMPv[2|3] (RFC 3376).
