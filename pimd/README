INTRODUCTION

        qpimd aims to implement a PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)
	daemon for the Quagga Routing Suite.

	Initially qpimd targets only PIM SSM (Source-Specific
	Multicast) mode as defined in section 4.8.2 (PIM-SSM-Only
	Routers) of RFC 4601.

	In order to deliver end-to-end multicast routing control
	plane, qpimd includes the router-side of IGMPv3	(RFC 3376).

PLATFORMS

	qpimd has been tested with Debian Lenny under Linux 2.6.

REQUIREMENTS

	qpimd requires Quagga (0.99.11 or higher from http://www.quagga.net)

	The GNU Build System (Autotools) is required to build from
	source code repository.

	gawk is also needed to build with Autotools. Any other awk
	usually won't work.

BUILDING FROM QUAGGA GIT REPOSITORY

	1) Get the latest quagga source tree

	# git clone git://code.quagga.net/quagga.git quagga

	2) Apply qpimd patch into quagga source tree

	# patch -p1 -d quagga < pimd-0.153-quagga-git20090623.patch

	3) Compile and install quagga

	# cd quagga
	# ./bootstrap.sh
	# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/quagga --enable-pimd
	# make
	# make install

BUILDING FROM QUAGGA TARBALL

	1) Get the latest quagga tarball

	# wget http://www.quagga.net/download/quagga-0.99.13.tar.gz

	2) Unpack the quagga tarball

	# tar xzf quagga-0.99.13.tar.gz

	3) Apply qpimd patch into quagga source tree

	# patch -p1 -d quagga-0.99.13 < pimd-0.153-quagga-0.99.13.patch

	4) Compile and install quagga

	# cd quagga-0.99.13
	# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/quagga --enable-pimd
	# make
	# make install

USAGE

	1) Configure and start the zebra daemon

	# cp /usr/local/quagga/etc/zebra.conf.sample /usr/local/quagga/etc/zebra.conf
	# vi /usr/local/quagga/etc/zebra.conf
	# /usr/local/quagga/sbin/zebra

	2) Configure and start the pimd daemon

	# cp /usr/local/quagga/etc/pimd.conf.sample /usr/local/quagga/etc/pimd.conf
	# vi /usr/local/quagga/etc/pimd.conf
	# /usr/local/quagga/sbin/pimd

	3) Access pimd vty interface at port TCP 2611

	# telnet localhost 2611

CONFIGURATION COMMANDS

	See available commands in the file pimd/COMMANDS.

KNOWN CAVEATS

	See list of known caveats in the file pimd/CAVEATS.
