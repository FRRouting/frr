* Rust Binary Daemon Skeleton

This is the skeleton for a native rust based FRR daemon. The daemon is built as
a rust binary with bindgen access to FRR infra.

** Development
*** Editor/LSP support

In order for LSP support to work you will likely need to do a couple things if
you use a build directory.

- Create 2 symlinks from the generated files in ~BUILDDIR/rustbind~ for
   `build.rs` and `wrapper.h` e.g. if your build dir is in `frr/build`:

  #+begin_src bash
    cd frr/rustbind
    ln -s ../build/rustbind/build.rs .
    ln -s ../build/rustbind/wrapper.h .
  #+end_src

- Copy the created `Cargo.toml` from BUILDDIR and modify the path value to be
  `rustbin_main.rs` (i.e., no path prefix).
