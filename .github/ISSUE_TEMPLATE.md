# HOW TO GET YOUR ISSUE ADDRESSED FASTER

* When reporting a crash provide a backtrace
* When pasting configs, logs, shell output, backtraces, and other large chunks
  of text [use Markdown code blocks](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-blocks)
* Include the FRR version; if you built from Git, please provide the commit
  hash

### How to submit an issue

the entire section if it does not apply to your issue. For example in case of
a question or feature request, just a description with some example is probably
fine. Also remember to use GitHub Flavored Markdown properly, especially if
posting output or code listings.
