* SAFETY MEASURES:
==================

Please consider setting this package "on hold" by typing
    echo "frr hold" | dpkg --set-selections
and verifying this using
    dpkg --get-selections | grep 'hold$'

Setting a package "on hold" means that it will not automatically be upgraded.
Instead apt-get only displays a warning saying that a new version would be
available forcing you to explicitly type "apt-get install frr" to upgrade it.


* What is frr?
=================

http://www.freerangerouting.net/
> Frr is a routing software suite, providing implementations of OSPFv2,
> OSPFv3, RIP v1 and v2, RIPv3 and BGPv4 for Unix platforms, particularly
> FreeBSD and Linux and also NetBSD, to mention a few. Frr is a fork of GNU
> Zebra which was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro. Development of GNU Zebra
> slowed dramatically to the point where eventually GNU Zebra was forked into
> Frr.

> The Frr tree is an attempt to provide a zebra tree with at least the
> bug-fixes, which have accumulated, applied, while tracking any significant
> changes made to the zebra.org tree. Ultimately, this tree hopes to revitalise
> development of this code base.

I packaged zebra-pj which was then renamed to frr to get people used to it
and offer Debian users the choice which versions they like to use. I hope this
brings frr some feedback and helps it evolving to a good successor of the
orphaned zebra.

* Why has SNMP support been disabled?
=====================================
Frr used to link against the NetSNMP libraries to provide SNMP
support. Those libraries sadly link against the OpenSSL libraries
to provide crypto support for SNMPv3 among others.
OpenSSL now is not compatible with the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL)
licence that Frr is distributed under. For more explanation read:
  http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html
  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs
Updating the licence to explecitly allow linking against OpenSSL
would requite the affirmation of all people that ever contributed
a significant part to Zebra or Frr and thus are the collective
"copyright holder". That's too much work. Using a shrinked down 
version of NetSNMP without OpenSSL or convincing the NetSNMP people
to change to GnuTLS are maybe good solutions but not reachable
during the last days before the Sarge release :-(

        *BUT*

It is allowed by the used licence mix that you fetch the sources and
build Frr yourself with SNMP with
	<remove the "grep ^smux" block at the end of debian/frr.preinst>
        # export WANT_SNMP=1
        # apt-get -b source frr
Just distributing it in binary form, linked against OpenSSL, is forbidden.


* Daemon selection:
===================

The Debian package uses /etc/frr/daemons to tell the
initscript which daemons to start. It's in the format
<daemon>=<yes|no|priority>
with no spaces (it's simply source-d into the initscript).
Default is not to start anything, since it can hose your
system's routing table if not set up properly.

Priorities were suggested by Dancer <dancer@zeor.simegen.com>.
They're used to start the Frr daemons in more than one step
(for example start one or two at network initialization and the
rest later). The number of Frr daemons being small, priorities
must be between 1 and 9, inclusive (or the initscript has to be
changed). /etc/init.d/frr then can be started as

/etc/init.d/frr <start|stop|restart|<priority>>

where priority 0 is the same as 'stop', priority 10 or 'start'
means 'start all'


* Error message "privs_init: initial cap_set_proc failed":
==========================================================

This error message means that "capability support" has to be built
into the kernel.


* Error message "netlink-listen: overrun: No buffer space available":
=====================================================================

If this message occurs the receive buffer should be increased by adding the
following to /etc/sysctl.conf and "--nl-bufsize" to /etc/frr/debian.conf.
> net.core.rmem_default = 262144
> net.core.rmem_max = 262144
See message #4525 from 2005-05-09 in the frr-users mailing list.


* vtysh immediately exists:
===========================

Check /etc/pam.d/frr, it probably denies access to your user. The passwords
configured in /etc/frr/Frr.conf are only for telnet access.
