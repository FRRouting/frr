Description: FRRouting suite of internet protocols (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, ...)
 FRRouting implements the routing protocols commonly used in the
 internet and private networks to exchange information between routers.
 Both IP and IPv6 are supported, as are BGP, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BABEL,
 EIGRP, RIP, RIPng, LDP, BFD, PIM, VRRP, PBR, and NHRP.
 .
 These protocols are used to turn your system into a dynamic router,
 exchanging information about available connections with other routers
 in a standards-compliant way.  The actual packet forwarding
 functionality is provided by the OS kernel.
 .
 FRRouting is a fork of Quagga with an open community model. The main
 git lives on https://github.com/frrouting/frr.git and the project name
 is commonly abbreviated as "FRR."

Package: frr-snmp
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: frr (= ${binary:Version}),
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Recommends: snmpd
Description: FRRouting suite - SNMP support
 Adds SNMP support to FRR's daemons by attaching to net-snmp's snmpd
 through the AgentX protocol.  Provides read-only access to current
 routing state through standard SNMP MIBs.

Package: frr-rpki-rtrlib
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: frr (= ${binary:Version}),
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: FRRouting suite - BGP RPKI support (rtrlib)
 Adds RPKI support to FRR's bgpd, allowing validation of BGP routes
 against cryptographic information stored in WHOIS databases.  This is
 used to prevent hijacking of networks on the wider internet.  It is only
 relevant to internet service providers using their own autonomous system
 number.

Description: FRRouting suite - user manual
 This provides the FRR user manual in HTML form.  This is the official
 manual maintained as part of the package and is also available online
 at https://frrouting.readthedocs.io/

Package: frr-pythontools
Architecture: all
Depends: frr (<< ${source:Upstream-Version}.0-~),
         frr (>= ${source:Version}~),
         python3:any,
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: FRRouting suite - Python tools
 The FRRouting suite uses a small Python tool to provide configuration
 reload functionality, particularly useful when the interactive configuration
 shell is not used.
 .
 Without this package installed, "reload" (as a systemd or init script
 invocation) will not work for the FRR daemons.
