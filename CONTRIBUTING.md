Contributing to FRRouting
========================

Thanks for considering a pull request or issue report.  Below are a
few hints and tips in order to make them as effective as possible.

Issue reports
-------------

Issue reports can be bug reports or feature requests.  Make sure to
search the issues before adding a new one.  It is often better to
join ongoing discussions on similar issues than creating a new one
as there may be workarounds or ideas available.

When creating bug reports, please make sure you provide the following:

* The current FRRouting version where the bug first appeared
* The last FRRouting version where the bug did not exist
* A list of steps to replicate the bug

Feature requests that are in line with project goals will eventually
be added to the roadmap:

And above all: stay kind and open. :)

* Base your code on the latest master branch to avoid manual merges
