    DESCRIPTION
        "Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol (EIGRP) is a Cisco
         proprietary distance vector routing protocol.   It is based on
         the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL), which is a method of
         finding loop-free paths through a network.   Directly
         connected routers running EIGRP form neighbor adjacencies in
         order to propagate best-path and alternate-path routing
         information for configured and learned routes.

         The tables defined within the MIB are closely aligned with how
         the router command-line interface for EIGRP displays
         information on EIGRP configurations, i.e., the topology table
         contains objects associated with the EIGRP topology commands,
         and the peer table contains objects associated withe EIGRP
         neighbor commands, etc.

         There are five main tables within this mib:

            EIGRP VPN table
               Contains information regarding which virtual private
               networks (VPN) are configured with EIGRP.

            EIGRP traffic statistics table
               Contains counter & statistcs regarding specific types of
               EIGRP packets sent and related collective information
               per VPN and per autonomous system (AS).

            EIGRP topology table
               Contains information regarding EIGRP routes received in
               updates and originated locally.   EIGRP sends and
               receives routing updates from adjacent routers running
               EIGRP with which it formed a peer relationship.

            EIGRP peer (neighbor) table
               Contains information about neighbor EIGRP routers with
               which peer adjacencies have been established.   EIGRP
               uses a Hello protocol to form neighbor relationships
               with directly connected routers also running EIGRP.

            EIGRP interfaces table
               Contains information and statistics on each of the
               interfaces on the router over which EIGRP has been
               configured to run."
