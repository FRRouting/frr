The FRRouting project consists of parts with various licenses.  Any particular
file's license should be indicated at the top of the file with an SPDX License
identifier.

The full text of all licenses used can be found in doc/licenses.

The composite work (binary) resulting from compiling FRR is thought to always
be distributable under GPLv2 or later.  However, please note that this is
simply an expression of the community's best-effort understanding, it is not a
legal statement, guarantee, or advice of any kind.  If necessary, please
familiarize yourself with the specifics and/or consult a lawyer.

Also please be advised that FRR's documentation is, for historical reasons,
licensed under a custom (but relatively permissive) license.  This license
dates back to the GNU Zebra project and cannot easily be changed into something
more common, short of rewriting the entire documentation.
