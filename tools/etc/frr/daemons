# This file tells the frr package which daemons to start.
#
# Entries are in the format: <daemon>=(yes|no|priority)
#   0, "no"  = disabled
#   1, "yes" = highest priority
#   2 .. 10  = lower priorities
# Read /usr/share/doc/frr/README.Debian for details.
#
# Sample configurations for these daemons can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/frr/examples/.
#
# ATTENTION:
#
# When activation a daemon at the first time, a config file, even if it is
# empty, has to be present *and* be owned by the user and group "frr", else
# the daemon will not be started by /etc/init.d/frr. The permissions should
# be u=rw,g=r,o=.
# When using "vtysh" such a config file is also needed. It should be owned by
# group "frrvty" and set to ug=rw,o= though. Check /etc/pam.d/frr, too.
#
# The watchfrr daemon is always started. Per default in monitoring-only but
# that can be changed via /etc/frr/daemons.conf.
